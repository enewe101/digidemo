To create the test data:

1) run test\_data.sql against your database (the database should have been
	created and linked to digidemo as part of the installation process, 
	see `<proj-root>/README.md`).
2) copy the contents of `<proj-root>/data/media` into `<proj-root>/media`
3) navigate to `localhost/proposals/keystone_xl` to see the test proposal.
