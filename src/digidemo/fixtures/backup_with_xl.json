If you make $100,000 from your TFSA investment, you have made more than with any other account because there is no tax on this profit. However, if you lose the money you contributed then you cannot claim tax deduction for capital loss and you also lose the contribution room.  Thus, a self-directed TFSA makes sense for very knowledgeable investors and traders, who have high confidence that the investments will generate positive return. The interest for a currency account may also be of advantageous to wealthy Canadians who can continuously make the maximum allowed contributions and benefit from compounding.\r\nTo answer your question: the incentive for a non-self-directed TFSA is primarily for the average Canadian who is not a knowledgeable investor and for whom a loss in a TFSA costs much more than a loss in RRSP or in a regular investment account.",

    "title": "Keystone XL Pipeline Extension",
    "text": "# Actors #\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\n- **US Government**:\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\n     - **Canadian Government**:\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\n         - WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\n        \n        # Impacts #\n        ## Environmental Impacts ##\n        **Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\n        \n        The path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length\n        of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\n        \n        **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \n        If the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from\n        Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\n        \n        ## Economic Impacts ##\n        **Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \n        \n        **Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\n        \n        # Social Impacts #\n        **Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\n        \n        **Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\n        \n        **Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\n        \n        # In Perspective #\n         - The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\n         - The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\n         - The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\n         - There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\n         - Alternative projects are being considered:\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

The pipeline would be newly constructed, and is similar to existing pipelines in North America.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.",

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\n        The path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length\r\n        of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n        **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n        If the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from\r\n        Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n        ## Economic Impacts ##\r\n        **Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n        **Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n        # Social Impacts #\r\n        **Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n        **Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n        **Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n        # In Perspective #\r\n         - The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n         - The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n         - The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n         - There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n         - Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.

Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.

Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.

Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.

However, the debate on Net Neutrality was ongoing prior to that. Advocates for Net Neutrality are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network infrastructure to block or otherwise deteriorate access to content, services or websites which are competitors to, or deemed undesirable by, the ISP.\r\nCritics of Net Neutrality claim that network management is needed in order to ensure Quality of Service and to prioritize critical applications such as VoIP telephony or email, over less critical ones, like peer-to-peer networks.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Internet Service Providers**: Companies which connect retail customers to the Internet. Examples include Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Rogers, etc.\r\n - **Transit Service Providers**: Companies, sometimes ISPs or hosting providers, which interconnect ISPs. They are responsible for the backbone of the Internet. When content moves from a hosting provider to an ISP, the Transit Service Providers may collect fees. Examples include Cogent Communications, Hurricane Electric, Level 3 Communications, etc.\r\n - **Established Content Providers**: Include Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. These are large companies, responsible for the majority of content carried over the Internet.\r\n - **Government**: The Government can impose a law on ISPs, requiring Net Neutrality. The main interest of the government is to ensure fair access to content, while promoting economic activity.\r\n - **Alternative Content Providers**: Services like Vimeo, Mega, Popcorn Time and other emerging providers. They may be unable to enter in agreements with ISPs due to lack of funding or legal impediments.\r\n - **Internet Users**: Ordinary people want to maximize their access to content and connection quality, while keeping prices low.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Social Impacts ##\r\n**Content Monopoly**. Alternative content providers are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network to \u201clock-out\u201d competing services or those unable to enter into traffic shaping agreements.\r\n\r\n**Censorship**. Internet users are worry of the impact that control over access to content may have on democracy and freedoms.\r\n\r\n**Quality of Service**. Internet providers claim that some popular content providers cause saturation of the network and degrade the Internet service for all users. Some users are concerned that degraded network performance may impact essential communications services such as access to 911 over VoIP lines.\r\n\r\n**Inequality**. Some content providers claim that the design of Internet protocols already imposes inequality by favouring non time-sensitive applications, such as large file downloads, over real time services like VoIP or multiplayer games. They argue that network management techniques level the playing field for time-sensitive applications.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Internet Service Innovations**. ISPs are concerned that a few content providers utilize most of the available network bandwidth without paying a proportional access fee. Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon. It is debatable whether peering agreements are a violation of Net Neutrality, however they were reached in response to deteriorated performance of access to Netflix content over the ISPs\u2019 networks.

Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon. It is debatable whether peering agreements are a violation of Net Neutrality, however they were reached in response to deteriorated performance of access to Netflix content over the ISPs\u2019 networks. (Waniata, Ryan. \"Comcast Jumps up in Netflix Speed Rankings after Payola-style Agreement.\" Digital Trends. N.p., 14 Apr. 2014. Web. 15 Aug. 2014.) (Waniata, Ryan. \"Netflix Calls Verizon out on the Big Red Screen [Update: Netflix Backs Off].\" Digital Trends. N.p., 9 June 2014. Web. 15 Aug. 2014.)",

ISPs may not apply traffic shaping or other network management techniques based on the type of content or the parties that are exchanging it. Proponents of Net Neutrality claim that in this respect it is similar to a telephone call: a phone company must treat all calls equally, regardless of what is being said or by whom.\r\nThere is a debate, particularly in the United States, whether the government should enact the Net Neutrality principle as a law.",

    "title": "Bill C-13, Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act",
    "text": "# Background #\r\nA central nominal goal of Bill C-13 is to criminalize cyberbullying [1], which the Canadian Bar Association identifies as an 'Obvious legislative \"gap\"' [1]. In order to collect data, authorities must suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the information will assist in the crime's investigation. \r\n\r\nThe bill establishes (in section 162.1) that sharing \"intimate images\" of a person, when the person in the image has not consented to the sharing, is an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.  Although the bill has been described (by Peter MacKay) as intended to protect children and youth from online predators, existing Criminal Code provisions (section 163.1 - Child Pornography) already criminalize the mere posession of such images, with harsher penalty.  Therefore, this bill only extends the provisions against the use of intimate images involving adults [1].\r\n\r\nSection 162.1 also does not establish the need for malicious intent.  This means that in a hypothetical situation where Mr. Smith lends his laptop to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith might be liable for having shared intimate images of him and his wife, even though they are in a deep folder marked \"private\", and he did not think that Mr. Jones would look there [1]. Other possibilities exist, and arise wording in section 162.1 which permits wide interpretation [1].  This also exposes the media, such as photojournalists, to criminal sanction for publishing compromising images of celebrities or politicians [1].\r\n\r\nThe Bar proposed other amendments to encourage a focus on cyberbullying and proportionate sentencing [1].  Further, they warn against excessive reliance on law to handle cyberbullying committed by youth, which may be less effective than education and other preventative measures [1]. \r\n\r\nBill C-13 goes far beyond cyberbullying, and instead describes provisions for the search and seizure of Internet Data, revisiting \"lawful access\" legislation, which has previously been controversial [1].  The Canadian Bar Association recommended splitting the Bill into two bills, one which addresses cyberbullying, and the other to address lawful access legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Association of the Bar acknowledges the concern of the Canadian Government, but has recommended that enhancements to state power which infringe on privacy should be coupled with effective oversight mechanisms. [1]\r\n\r\nSection 487.012 provides the power for police officers to make \"preservation demands\", without any judicial authorization, which requires a person to preserve (i.e. not delete) data, if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the data will assist in the investigation, or that a crime under any Foreign law has or will be committed.  In the case of crimes in Canada, preservation would be for 21 days, while for foreign laws, for 90 days.  The CBA recommended reducing these periods to only cover a reasonable amount of time needed to get judicial authorization, and that preservation demands should only be applicable for crimes according to foreign laws which would also be crimes in Canada.  The Act does not require written records to be kept. (CBA recommends this be required.)\r\n\r\nSubsection 5 of 487.012 gives officers the ability to impose unlimited conditions on preservation demands.  According to CBA, such conditions could prevent a party from exercising lawful rights, and such restrictions should only be imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe bill empowers judges to issue production orders for tracking data (such as GPS data), information identifying financial account holders, and the use of tracking devices, but with a lower threshold than previously existed -- \r\nonly requiring that the judge be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that on offense has or will be committed.\r\n\r\nSection 492.2 updates laws which enabled officers to obtain telephone metadata to allow law enforcement to install \"transmission data recorders\" to capture metadata related to any kind of telecommunications.

    "title": "Bill C-51 Anti-terrorism Act, 2015",
    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offense\" and \"Terrorist propoganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offenses\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about the bill have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propoganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offense [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a resonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  The bill allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe act introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promation\" of terrorism offenses.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     *Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years.* [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n - In the bill, terrorist propoganda is defined as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propoganda ##\r\n - The bill allows judges to order \"custodians\" of computer systems (such as the operators of websites, or ISPs) to delete material deemed to be terrorist propoganda.  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision.[7]\r\n - Bill C-51 contains a section that gives the government the power to order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or website administrators to remove content if a judge deems the material to be \"terrorist propoganda\" [1]\r\n - The RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent.[5] \r\n - For comparison, existing legislation allows ordering the removal of \"hate propoganda\" and child pornography. [1]\r\n - The department of justice says that this is similar to legislation existing in UK and Australia. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Powers for CSIS ##\r\n - CSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere with terrorist plots, by [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\n - The bill allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfill their mandates and when it is a matter of national security [7]\r\n - In June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs. [1][2][3]\r\n - Judges can order ISPs to provide identidying information of the sources of terrorist propoganda so that they may be located [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No fly list ##\r\n - The bill establishes a list of individuals, to be maintained by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  People may be added to the list if\r\n    - the minister has reasonable grounds to suspect that they will threaten transportation security\r\n    - commit a \"terrorism offense\" in Canada, or an act which, if committed in canada would constitute a \"terrorism offense\"\r\nSuch people may be denied travel, and Air carriers can be compelled to assist in ensuring that listed people do are unable to carry out \"terrorism offenses\" or acts that threaten the transportation security.\r\n - a listed person that has been denied transportation has the right request that their names be removed from the list, and to be given reasonable opportunity to represent themselves, as well as appeal to a judge to have their name removed.\r\n - with certain exceptins, the list is to be kept secret.   \r\n\r\n - extends the minister of transport's abilities to obtain documents from or inspect any aircraft, aerodome, or other aviation facility or any premises used by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\n - Allowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time. \r\n - By rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\n - By lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue surveillance of those expressing political dissent. [1]\r\n - The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to shifting and overreaching prosecution [5].\r\n - It is suggested [6] that demonstrations and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability.  As an example, consider demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\n - Material considered to be \"terrorist propoganda\" could be essentially removed from the Internet normally accessible to Canadians.\r\n - Political and artistic expression, near the fringe, may be self-sensored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propoganda\". [1]\r\n - The uncertainty created by the law may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, because they may believe they will be found guilty for their beliefs. [5] \r\n - Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels specifically, or simply the rebellion against totalitarian regimes in principle, could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\". [6]\r\nIt may be possible for artistic expression and political dissent to be construed as terrorist propoganda, interfearing with open dialogue and expression.[1] \r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - In the UK in 2010 more than 65,000 pieces of unlawful terrorist related content was removed, 80% of which was jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria[1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order, while the law enables the government to compel hosts in the UK to remove content.[1] \r\n - In Australia ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order.[1]\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked / removed.

    "title": "Bill C-51 Anti-terrorism Act, 2015",
    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offense\" and \"Terrorist propoganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offenses\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about the bill have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propoganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offense [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a resonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  The bill allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promation\" of terrorism offenses.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propoganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision.[7]\r\nCurrently, the RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5], and it the criminalization of terrorist propoganda might interfere with the availability of natural intelligence through social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n## New Powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offenses, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nThe bill allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfill their mandates and when it is a matter of national security [7].

Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from traveling, or subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe bill lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from traveling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\n - Allowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time. \r\n - By rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\n - By lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue surveillance of those expressing political dissent.

    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offense\" and \"Terrorist propoganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offenses\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about the bill have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propoganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offense [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a resonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  The bill allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promation\" of terrorism offenses.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propoganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision.[7]\r\nCurrently, the RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5], and it the criminalization of terrorist propoganda might interfere with the availability of natural intelligence through social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offenses, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nThe bill allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfill their mandates and when it is a matter of national security [7].  Judges can order ISPs to provide identidying information of the sources of terrorist propoganda so that they may be located [4].  Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from traveling, or subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe bill lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from traveling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\nAllowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time, and will likely lead to more effective protection against terrorist activities [4].\r\n\r\nBy rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground, leading to less effective protection against terrorist activities [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\nBy lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue and unnecessary surveillance of those expressing political dissent [1].  The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to \"prosecutory overreach\" [5].\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested [6] that protests and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability.  As an example, consider demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\nMaterial considered to be \"terrorist propoganda\" could be partially removed from the Internet normally accessible to Canadians.\r\nPolitical and artistic expression, \"near the fringe\", may be self-censored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propaganda\". [1]\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty created by the law may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, for example, as part of the CVE program, because those people might be more fearful of law enforcement [5]. \r\n\r\nThe wide interpretation of \"terrorism advocacy\" could hamper the freedom of expression.  Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\" [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - Existing legislation allows a judge to order the removal of \"hate propoganda\" and child pornography [1]\r\n - In the UK in 2010 more than 65,000 pieces of unlawful terrorist related content was removed, 80% of which was jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria [1]\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked / removed. [1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order [1] \r\n - In Australia ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order.[1]\r\n - Relative to France, the US, Australia, and Britain, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation is \"less invasive\".[4]\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC.

    "title": "Doubling TFSA contribution limits",
    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe TFSA account was first introduced in 2009 to encourage Canadians to save. Originally the account allowed for contributions of up to $5,000 per year. \r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Government**: The Government wants to provide incentive for Canadians to save money. At the same time it has to balance the budget and ensure that no group of Canadians are unfairly benefiting from the regulations. \r\n - **Banks**: Banks benefit by holding TFSA deposits because the rules of this account discourage Canadians from withdrawing money on a regular basis. When money is withdrawn from a TFSA account, the contribution room is not freed up until the following year. By having longer-term accounts banks can invest the funds in lucrative mortgages or credit card offers, while giving only a negligible portion of the earnings as interest back to the TFSA account holder.\r\n - **Average Canadians**: The average working class Canadian benefits from TFSA accounts by means of tax-free interest and incentive to keep healthy financial discipline.\r\n - **Savvy investors and traders**: Savvy investors and traders are able to exploit the full potential of a TFSA. The TFSA is a very flexible investment vehicle, particularly if used as a self-directed account. It can hold a large variety of securities and financial instruments, similar to a RRSP account. The few exclusions relate to shares in companies of which the TFSA account holder has controlling role. Savvy individuals with access to highly lucrative investments have a virtually unlimited potential to earn tax-free income by re-investing earnings within the TFSA account.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Unfair advantages ##\r\n**Tax avoidance**. When the TFSA was first introduced, savvy investors and traders took unfair advantage of the weak penalties for over-contribution and unqualified investments. The original penalty for over contribution was only 1% per month (and only on the over-contributions). Wealthy investors with access to investments with high returns were over-contributing $100,000 or more, paying the 1% penalty and still keeping all returns as tax-free income. Furthermore, initially the penalty for purchasing prohibited investments inside a TFSA (such as the shares of a company you control) was simply forfeiting the purchase. I.e., investors with questionable morality were allowed to keep any capital gains from breaking the rules, without paying tax[1].\r\nWhile the rules have since changed to prevent the most obvious tax avoidance schemes, questions still remain about what other opportunities for abuse are being exploited.\r\n\r\n**Unequal opportunities**. In 2010 big banks held 75% of Tax-Free Savings Accounts[2]. That is to say, 75% of accounts were giving their owners only the marginal interest rate that the big banks offer. At the same time, the remaining 25% of TFSAs were self-directed or held by other institutions, offering lucrative investments with limitless tax exemption to those in the know. Fast-forward to 2012, less than 16% of TFSA account holders under 60 years old had reached the $5,500 contribution limit[3]. I.e., only 16% of the economically active Canadian residents with TFSA accounts have enough spare income to reach the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit. If the limit is doubled, then, fewer than 16% of working Canadians will be able to benefit from this tax-break.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Loss of tax income**. By having no limits on the types of investments in a TFSA, the government in power leaves an unpredictable tax loss for future governments. The amount of tax wealthy investors and knowledgeable traders will not pay into future budgets depends only on their luck and skills. Doubling the contribution limit has cumulative impact on the tax loss, as any earnings can be re-invested freely.\r\n\r\n**Reduced economic activity**. Encouraging Canadians to invest up to $11,000 of their yearly income in a savings account and penalizing them (by means of lost contribution room) for withdrawals, may negatively impact local businesses as less money will be circulating in the economy. This will put deflationary pressure on an economy that is already struggling to achieve inflation targets.\r\n\r\n**Cushion for rate hike**. The TFSA can have a positive impact on the economy by providing a cushion for future changes that may take households by surprise. For instance, the abnormally low interest rate has allowed a large number of people to take mortgages. If the interest rates recover, a TFSA could save home-owners who are facing unexpected increase in the payments for their home.\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/tfsa-move-targets-savvy-investors/article4215495/\r\n[2] http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxman-may-forgive-tfsa-rule-breakers/article1373287/\r\n[3] http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doubling-tfsa-limit-will-only-help-wealthy-study-argues-1.2967796",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "title": "Net Neutrality",
    "text": "\r\n#Background#\r\nThe term Net Neutrality was originally coined by professor Tim Wu in 2003 (http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF). However, the debate on Net Neutrality was ongoing prior to that. Advocates for Net Neutrality are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network infrastructure to block or otherwise deteriorate access to content, services or websites which are competitors to, or deemed undesirable by, the ISP.\r\nCritics of Net Neutrality claim that network management is needed in order to ensure Quality of Service and to prioritize critical applications such as VoIP telephony or email, over less critical ones, like peer-to-peer networks.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Internet Service Providers**: Companies which connect retail customers to the Internet. Examples include Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Rogers, etc.\r\n - **Transit Service Providers**: Companies, sometimes ISPs or hosting providers, which interconnect ISPs. They are responsible for the backbone of the Internet. When content moves from a hosting provider to an ISP, the Transit Service Providers may collect fees. Examples include Cogent Communications, Hurricane Electric, Level 3 Communications, etc.\r\n - **Established Content Providers**: Include Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. These are large companies, responsible for the majority of content carried over the Internet.\r\n - **Government**: The Government can impose a law on ISPs, requiring Net Neutrality. The main interest of the government is to ensure fair access to content, while promoting economic activity.\r\n - **Alternative Content Providers**: Services like Vimeo, Mega, Popcorn Time and other emerging providers. They may be unable to enter in agreements with ISPs due to lack of funding or legal impediments.\r\n - **Internet Users**: Ordinary people want to maximize their access to content and connection quality, while keeping prices low.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Social Impacts ##\r\n**Content Monopoly**. Alternative content providers are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network to \u201clock-out\u201d competing services or those unable to enter into traffic shaping agreements.\r\n\r\n**Censorship**. Internet users are worry of the impact that control over access to content may have on democracy and freedoms.\r\n\r\n**Quality of Service**. Internet providers claim that some popular content providers cause saturation of the network and degrade the Internet service for all users. Some users are concerned that degraded network performance may impact essential communications services such as access to 911 over VoIP lines.\r\n\r\n**Inequality**. Some content providers claim that the design of Internet protocols already imposes inequality by favouring non time-sensitive applications, such as large file downloads, over real time services like VoIP or multiplayer games. They argue that network management techniques level the playing field for time-sensitive applications.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Internet Service Innovations**. ISPs are concerned that a few content providers utilize most of the available network bandwidth without paying a proportional access fee. Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon. It is debatable whether peering agreements are a violation of Net Neutrality, however they were reached in response to deteriorated performance of access to Netflix content over the ISPs\u2019 networks.

ISPs may not apply traffic shaping or other network management techniques based on the type of content or the parties that are exchanging it.

    "title": "Bill C-13, Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act",
    "text": "# Background #\r\nA central nominal goal of Bill C-13 is to criminalize cyberbullying [1], which the Canadian Bar Association identifies as an 'Obvious legislative \"gap\"' [1]. In order to collect data, authorities must suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the information will assist in the crime's investigation. \r\n\r\nThe bill establishes (in section 162.1) that sharing \"intimate images\" of a person, when the person in the image has not consented to the sharing, is an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.  Although the bill has been described (by Peter MacKay) as intended to protect children and youth from online predators, existing Criminal Code provisions (section 163.1 - Child Pornography) already criminalize the mere posession of such images, with harsher penalty.  Therefore, this bill only extends the provisions against the use of intimate images involving adults [1].\r\n\r\nSection 162.1 also does not establish the need for malicious intent.  This means that in a hypothetical situation where Mr. Smith lends his laptop to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith might be liable for having shared intimate images of him and his wife, even though they are in a deep folder marked \"private\", and he did not think that Mr. Jones would look there [1]. Other possibilities exist, and arise wording in section 162.1 which permits wide interpretation [1].  This also exposes the media, such as photojournalists, to criminal sanction for publishing compromising images of celebrities or politicians [1].\r\n\r\nThe Bar proposed other amendments to encourage a focus on cyberbullying and proportionate sentencing [1].  Further, they warn against excessive reliance on law to handle cyberbullying committed by youth, which may be less effective than education and other preventative measures [1]. \r\n\r\nBill C-13 goes far beyond cyberbullying, and instead describes provisions for the search and seizure of Internet Data, revisiting \"lawful access\" legislation, which has previously been controversial [1].  The Canadian Bar Association recommended splitting the Bill into two bills, one which addresses cyberbullying, and the other to address lawful access legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Association of the Bar acknowledges the concern of the Canadian Government, but has recommended that enhancements to state power which infringe on privacy should be coupled with effective oversight mechanisms. [1]\r\n\r\nSection 487.012 provides the power for police officers to make \"preservation demands\", without any judicial authorization, which requires a person to preserve (i.e. not delete) data, if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the data will assist in the investigation, or that a crime under any Foreign law has or will be committed.  In the case of crimes in Canada, preservation would be for 21 days, while for foreign laws, for 90 days.  The CBA recommended reducing these periods to only cover a reasonable amount of time needed to get judicial authorization, and that preservation demands should only be applicable for crimes according to foreign laws which would also be crimes in Canada.  The Act does not require written records to be kept. (CBA recommends this be required.)\r\n\r\nSubsection 5 of 487.012 gives officers the ability to impose unlimited conditions on preservation demands.  According to CBA, such conditions could prevent a party from exercising lawful rights, and such restrictions should only be imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe bill empowers judges to issue production orders for tracking data (such as GPS data), information identifying financial account holders, and the use of tracking devices, but with a lower threshold than previously existed -- \r\nonly requiring that the judge be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that on offense has or will be committed.\r\n\r\nSection 492.2 updates laws which enabled officers to obtain telephone metadata to allow law enforcement to install \"transmission data recorders\" to capture metadata related to any kind of telecommunications.  Because of the richness of digital telecommunications, this could identify far more detailed biographical information about the individual, and so is a materially more severe invasion of privacy.  Warrants to use a transmission data recorder also only need to be justified by reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that an offense has or will be committed.  Information that could be captured would include\r\n\r\n - the IP address of the originating computer and server (i.e. website) being communicated with\r\n - the computer program being used\r\n - the protocol being used (identifying whether the person is viewing a website, using videoconferencing, etc)\r\n - whether the transmission was completed\r\n\r\nThis would enable, for example, to tell whether a person had been communicating on a regular basis with a particular health professional, or accessing a particular online service.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n- CSEC\r\n- Government of Canada\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Culture ##\r\n- The criminalization of cyberbullying would enable law enforcement to take action against people committing cyberbullying, and might reduce its prevalence.u \r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] Commentary by the Canadian Bar Association ([pdf](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDQQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cba.org%2Fcba%2Fsubmissions%2Fpdf%2F14-33-eng.pdf&ei=Lk3cVJm9DoagNuCTgbAG&usg=AFQjCNHfIQ7iJmSssJ-kyhHJvOqwUoLRGg&sig2=A7dmQIKgYQnp9SzNteMAOw&bvm=bv.85761416,d.eXY))",

    "title": "Bill C-51 Anti-terrorism Act, 2015",
    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offence\" and \"Terrorist propaganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offences\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about bill C-51 have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propaganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offence [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorist propaganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a reasonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  Bill C-51 allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promotion\" of terrorism offences.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propaganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision [7].\r\nCurrently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) runs a program entitled Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5]. However, the criminalization of terrorist propaganda might interfere with the availability of intelligence that would occur naturally on social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP, who can then act on it.  Bill C-51 will give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offences, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists,\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack,\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nBill c-51 allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfil their mandates, and when it is a matter of national security [7].  Judges can order Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide identifying information of the sources of terrorist propaganda so that they may be located [4].  Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No-fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no-fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from travelling, or who are subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nBill C-51 lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no-fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from travelling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\nAllowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time, and will likely lead to more effective protection against terrorist activities [4].\r\n\r\nBy rendering the promotion/advocacy of terrorist propaganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence could be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. This could lead to less effective protection against terrorist activities [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\nBy lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-censorship or undue and unnecessary surveillance of those expressing political dissent [1].  The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to \"persecutory overreach\" [5].\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that protests and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada, or its economic or financial stability [6].  As an example, consider a demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\nMaterial considered to be \"terrorist propaganda\" could be partially removed from the Internet information normally accessible to Canadians.\r\nPolitical and artistic expression \"near the fringe\" may be self-censored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propaganda\" [1].\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty created by Bill C-51 may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, for example, as part of the CVE program, because those people might be more fearful of law enforcement [5]. \r\n\r\nThe wide interpretation of \"terrorism advocacy\" could hamper the freedom of expression.  Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\" [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - Existing legislation allows a judge to order the removal of \"hate propaganda\" and child pornography [1].\r\n - In the UK, in 2010, more than 65 000 pieces of unlawful terrorism-related content was removed, 80% of which was from jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria [1].\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked and/or removed. [1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order [1]. \r\n - In Australia, ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content, and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order [1].\r\n - Relative to France, the USA, Australia, and the UK, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation is \"less invasive\" [4].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC.

    "title": "Doubling TFSA contribution limits",
    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe TFSA account was first introduced in 2009 to encourage Canadians to save. Originally the account allowed for contributions of up to $5,000 per year. \r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Government**: The Government wants to provide incentive for Canadians to save money. At the same time it has to balance the budget and ensure that no group of Canadians are unfairly benefiting from the regulations. \r\n - **Banks**: Banks benefit by holding TFSA deposits because the rules of this account discourage Canadians from withdrawing money on a regular basis. When money is withdrawn from a TFSA account, the contribution room is not freed up until the following year. By having longer-term accounts banks can invest the funds in lucrative mortgages or credit card offers, while giving only a negligible portion of the earnings as interest back to the TFSA account holder.\r\n - **Average Canadians**: The average working class Canadian benefits from TFSA accounts by means of tax-free interest and incentive to keep healthy financial discipline.\r\n - **Savvy investors and traders**: Savvy investors and traders are able to exploit the full potential of a TFSA. The TFSA is a very flexible investment vehicle, particularly if used as a self-directed account. It can hold a large variety of securities and financial instruments, similar to a RRSP account. The few exclusions relate to shares in companies of which the TFSA account holder has controlling role. Savvy individuals with access to highly lucrative investments have a virtually unlimited potential to earn tax-free income by re-investing earnings within the TFSA account.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Unfair advantages ##\r\n**Tax avoidance**. When the TFSA was first introduced, savvy investors and traders took unfair advantage of the weak penalties for over-contribution and unqualified investments. The original penalty for over contribution was only 1% per month (and only on the over-contributions). Wealthy investors with access to investments with high returns were over-contributing $100,000 or more, paying the 1% penalty and still keeping all returns as tax-free income. Furthermore, initially the penalty for purchasing prohibited investments inside a TFSA (such as the shares of a company you control) was simply forfeiting the purchase. I.e., investors with questionable morality were allowed to keep any capital gains from breaking the rules, without paying tax[1].\r\nWhile the rules have since changed to prevent the most obvious tax avoidance schemes, questions still remain about what other opportunities for abuse are being exploited.\r\n\r\n**Unequal opportunities**. In 2010 big banks held 75% of Tax-Free Savings Accounts[2]. That is to say, 75% of accounts were giving their owners only the marginal interest rate that the big banks offer. At the same time, the remaining 25% of TFSAs were self-directed or held by other institutions, offering lucrative investments with limitless tax exemption to those in the know. Fast-forward to 2012, less than 16% of TFSA account holders under 60 years old had reached the $5,500 contribution limit[3]. I.e., only 16% of the economically active Canadian residents with TFSA accounts have enough spare income to reach the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit. If the limit is doubled, then, fewer than 16% of working Canadians will be able to benefit from this tax-break.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Loss of tax income**. By having no limits on the types of investments in a TFSA, the government in power leaves an unpredictable tax loss for future governments. The amount of tax wealthy investors and knowledgeable traders will not pay into future budgets depends only on their luck and skills. Doubling the contribution limit has cumulative impact on the tax loss, as any earnings can be re-invested freely.\r\n\r\n**Reduced economic activity**. Encouraging Canadians to invest up to $11,000 of their yearly income in a savings account and penalizing them (by means of lost contribution room) for withdrawals, may negatively impact local businesses as less money will be circulating in the economy. This will put deflationary pressure on an economy that is already struggling to achieve inflation targets.\r\n\r\n**Cushion for rate hike**. The TFSA can have a positive impact on the economy by providing a cushion for future changes that may take households by surprise. For instance, the abnormally low interest rate has allowed a large number of people to take mortgages. If the interest rates recover, a TFSA could save home-owners who are facing unexpected increase in the payments for their home.\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/tfsa-move-targets-savvy-investors/article4215495/\r\n[2] http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxman-may-forgive-tfsa-rule-breakers/article1373287/\r\n[3] http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doubling-tfsa-limit-will-only-help-wealthy-study-argues-1.2967796",

In 2011, oilsands operators used about 170 million cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to the amount of water used by 1.7 million Canadians [2].  This demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2020 [1].\r\n\r\nSurface water that is taken for oilsands extraction cannot be returned because of the toxins in the waste water.  Some water can be recycled within the extraction process, but ultimately, the water taken in ends up as waste water which has to be stored in tailings ponds or injected deep underground [2].\r\n\r\nIn Alberta\u2019s north, water is abundant and demand is still ``relatively low''. But in the southern portion of the province, demand is straining the existing allocation regime and the ecology.   The southern basin is now closed to granting new surface water licenses [3].\r\nAverage discharge from lower Athebasca River's mouth into Lake Athabasca during low-flow periods was 30% less in 1996-2006 than it was in 1966-1976 [2].  Flow downstream of Fort McMurray is predicted to decrease by 30 per cent by 2050, due to the combined impacts of climate change and industrial water withdrawals [2].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater withdrawals during winter low-flow periods risk reducing the availability of fish habitat [1]. Reduction of water flow can destroy the conditions needed for viability of and developing embryos of aquatic species in the river [1]. Even a couple inches in water levels can be critical, said Schindler. [1]\r\n\r\nThe Athebasca River is used extensively by about 1000 people from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  According to Chief Allan Adam [1]:\r\n\r\n    When we hit low water levels, a lot of our people won't even be able to get into their \r\n    traditional territory\r\n\r\nAbout three-quarters of the Chipewyan people are on the river several times a week [1].\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to affecting water levels, there is evidence that, despite the fact that water drawn from the river is not returned, industrial activity is nevertheless introducing harmful chemicals into the Athebasca River.\r\nIndependent research suggests concentrations of dissolved polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) are higher downstream of oilsands development, in comparison to upstream, in tributaries to the Athabasca [2]. \r\nThis trend is more pronounced in the summer than in the winter [2].\r\nIndependent research has also found that sediment of lakes in the oilsands region (including one lake approximately 90 kilometres from the major development area) contain between 2.5 and 23 times higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than they did 50 years ago, before the industrial development of the oilsands began [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe draft water management framework recently released by the government of Alberta would regulate how much water can be removed at different times of the year [1].\r\nIts measures are expected to be implemented by fall 2015 [1].\r\nAt all times, total withdrawals would be a ``small fraction'' of the river's flow and would nearly stop when the Athabasca was flowing at its lowest rate [1].\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no research to suggest that the specific levels of withdrawals prescribed by the new water framework are compatible with the river ecosystem [1].\r\nThe framework is being heavily criticized for lack of scientific foundation [1].\r\nAndy Ridge, director of water policy for Alberta Environment, acknowledges that the in-the-field science is scarce in the report. [1]\r\nThe framework relies on computer modelling to supplement the lack of empirical data. [1]\r\nIn 2011, Environment Canada and a team of independent experts concluded that the current water monitoring system for the Athabasca region \u201cdid not deliver data of sufficient quantity or quality to detect or quantify the effects of oilsands development.\u201d[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Fish habitat, bug populations, water quality, groundwater, connections to tributaries -- none of those factors was considered. [1]\r\n - Even a couple inches in water levels can be critical, said Schindler. [1]\r\n - \"The main fear about low flows is that it will leave eggs and embryos high and dry. It's like nobody wants to get out into the field and do some actual biology to see what flows the (plants and animals) require.\" [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - We require industry to demonstrate that they are using the most appropriate source, namely that they\u2019re going to the brackish or the saline groundwater before they use fresh groundwater and before they use fresh surface water,\u201d Ridge says. [3]\r\n - This policy will put the onus on producers, particularly those involved in in-situ and hydraulic fracturing operations, to demonstrate that they have sourced, or exhausted all attempts to source, non-potable water and identified opportunities for water sharing and treatment before they are issued a license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Adam's band has filed for a judicial review of a land-use plan for the area that includes the water-use framework.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n- In CAPP\u2019s 2013 Crude Oil Forecast, oil sands production is projected to rise to 5.2 million bpd in 2030 from 1.8 million bpd in 2012.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CTV News, *Alberta's plan for Athabasca River 'pathetic,' not science-based: critics*](http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/alberta-s-plan-for-athabasca-river-pathetic-not-science-based-critics-1.1735778)\r\n[2] [Pembina Institute, *Water Impacts*, 2013](http://www.pembina.org/oil-sands/os101/water#footnote3_iuh07fc\r\n[3] [Alberta Oil, *Alberta desperately needs a water-management plan*, 2013](http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/07/alberta-and-the-life-aquatic/)",

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n - **Andy Ridge** -- Director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development.\r\n - **The Alberta Water Council** -- acts as an advisory board bringing stakeholders and experts together to oversee the implementation of water management strategies.\r\n - **Allan Adams** -- Chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  The Chipewyan First Nation uses the Athebasca river extensively, with three-quarters of their community on the river multiple times per week.\r\n - **Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)** -- an industry group representing the oilsands industry in Canada.\r\n - **Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI)** -- six oilsands companies that have initiated and advanced several improvements to water management practices.  Includes Suncor Energy Inc, ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Shell Canada Ltd., Statoil Canada and Total E+P Canada Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\nIn December 2014, the government of Alberta distributed a draft surface water quantity management framework for the Lower Athabasca River to industry, interest groups and First Nations [1].\r\n\r\nMost of the water used for extraction of petroleum from the Albertan oilsands is taken from the Athabasca River [2].  In 2011, oilsands operators used about 170 million cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to the amount of water used by 1.7 million Canadians [2].  This demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2020 [1].\r\n\r\nSurface water that is taken for oilsands extraction cannot be returned because of the toxins in the waste water.  Some water can be recycled within the extraction process, but ultimately, the water taken in ends up as waste water which has to be stored in tailings ponds or injected deep underground [2].\r\n\r\nIn Alberta\u2019s north, water is abundant and demand is still ``relatively low''. But in the southern portion of the province, demand is straining the existing allocation regime and the ecology.   The southern basin is now closed to granting new surface water licenses [3].\r\nAverage discharge from lower Athebasca River's mouth into Lake Athabasca during low-flow periods was 30% less in 1996-2006 than it was in 1966-1976 [2].  Flow downstream of Fort McMurray is predicted to decrease by 30 per cent by 2050, due to the combined impacts of climate change and industrial water withdrawals [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nWater withdrawals during winter low-flow periods risk reducing the availability of fish habitat [1]. Reduction of water flow can destroy the conditions needed for viability of and developing embryos of aquatic species in the river [1]. Even a couple inches in water levels can be critical, said Schindler. [1]\r\n\r\nThe Athebasca River is used extensively by about 1000 people from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  According to Chief Allan Adam [1]: \"When we hit low water levels, a lot of our people won't even be able to get into their traditional territory.\".\r\n\r\nAbout three-quarters of the Chipewyan people are on the river several times a week [1].\r\nAdam's band has filed for a judicial review of a land-use plan for the area that includes the water-use framework [1].\r\n\r\nIn addition to affecting water levels, there is evidence that, despite the fact that water drawn from the river is not returned, industrial activity is nevertheless introducing harmful chemicals into the Athebasca River.\r\nIndependent research suggests concentrations of dissolved polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) are higher downstream of oilsands development, in comparison to upstream, in tributaries to the Athabasca [2]. \r\nThis trend is more pronounced in the summer than in the winter [2].\r\nIndependent research has also found that sediment of lakes in the oilsands region (including one lake approximately 90 kilometres from the major development area) contain between 2.5 and 23 times higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than they did 50 years ago, before the industrial development of the oilsands began [2].\r\n\r\nThe draft water management framework recently released by the government of Alberta would regulate how much water can be removed at different times of the year [1].\r\nIts measures are expected to be implemented by fall 2015 [1].\r\nAt all times, total withdrawals would be a ``small fraction'' of the river's flow and would nearly stop when the Athabasca was flowing at its lowest rate [1].\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no research to suggest that the specific levels of withdrawals prescribed by the new water framework are compatible with the river ecosystem [1].\r\nThe framework is being heavily criticized as lacking a scientific foundation [1].\r\nThe framework does not include studies of the impacts to fish, insects, and other organisms, nor effects on water quality [1].\r\n\r\nAndy Ridge, director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, acknowledges that empirical data is scarce in the drafted framework [1].\r\nInstead, the framework relies on computer modelling to supplement the lack of empirical data [1].\r\nThis corroborates the 2011 findings of Environment Canada and a team of independent experts, who concluded that the current water monitoring system for the Athabasca region ``did not deliver data of sufficient quantity or quality to detect or quantify the effects of oilsands development.''

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe TFSA account was first introduced in 2009 to encourage Canadians to save. Originally the account allowed for contributions of up to $5,000 per year. \r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Government**: The Government wants to provide incentive for Canadians to save money. At the same time it has to balance the budget and ensure that no group of Canadians are unfairly benefiting from the regulations. \r\n - **Banks**: Banks benefit by holding TFSA deposits because the rules of this account discourage Canadians from withdrawing money on a regular basis. When money is withdrawn from a TFSA account, the contribution room is not freed up until the following year. By having longer-term accounts banks can invest the funds in lucrative mortgages or credit card offers, while giving only a negligible portion of the earnings as interest back to the TFSA account holder.\r\n - **Average Canadians**: The average working class Canadian benefits from TFSA accounts by means of tax-free interest and incentive to keep healthy financial discipline.\r\n - **Savvy investors and traders**: Savvy investors and traders are able to exploit the full potential of a TFSA. The TFSA is a very flexible investment vehicle, particularly if used as a self-directed account. It can hold a large variety of securities and financial instruments, similar to a RRSP account. The few exclusions relate to shares in companies of which the TFSA account holder has controlling role. Savvy individuals with access to highly lucrative investments have a virtually unlimited potential to earn tax-free income by re-investing earnings within the TFSA account.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Unfair advantages ##\r\n**Tax avoidance**. When the TFSA was first introduced, savvy investors and traders took unfair advantage of the weak penalties for over-contribution and unqualified investments. The original penalty for over contribution was only 1% per month (and only on the over-contributions). Wealthy investors with access to investments with high returns were over-contributing $100,000 or more, paying the 1% penalty and still keeping all returns as tax-free income. Furthermore, initially the penalty for purchasing prohibited investments inside a TFSA (such as the shares of a company you control) was simply forfeiting the purchase. I.e., investors with questionable morality were allowed to keep any capital gains from breaking the rules, without paying tax[1].\r\nWhile the rules have since changed to prevent the most obvious tax avoidance schemes, questions still remain about what other opportunities for abuse are being exploited.\r\n\r\n**Unequal opportunities**. In 2010 big banks held 75% of Tax-Free Savings Accounts[2]. That is to say, 75% of accounts were giving their owners only the marginal interest rate that the big banks offer. At the same time, the remaining 25% of TFSAs were self-directed or held by other institutions, offering lucrative investments with limitless tax exemption to those in the know. Fast-forward to 2012, less than 16% of TFSA account holders under 60 years old had reached the $5,500 contribution limit[3]. I.e., only 16% of the economically active Canadian residents with TFSA accounts have enough spare income to reach the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit. If the limit is doubled, then, fewer than 16% of working Canadians will be able to benefit from this tax-break.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Loss of tax income**. By having no limits on the types of investments in a TFSA, the government in power leaves an unpredictable tax loss for future governments. The amount of tax wealthy investors and knowledgeable traders will not pay into future budgets depends only on their luck and skills. Doubling the contribution limit has cumulative impact on the tax loss, as any earnings can be re-invested freely.\r\n\r\n**Reduced economic activity**. Encouraging Canadians to invest up to $11,000 of their yearly income in a savings account and penalizing them (by means of lost contribution room) for withdrawals, may negatively impact local businesses as less money will be circulating in the economy. This will put deflationary pressure on an economy that is already struggling to achieve inflation targets.\r\n\r\n**Cushion for rate hike**. The TFSA can have a positive impact on the economy by providing a cushion for future changes that may take households by surprise. For instance, the abnormally low interest rate has allowed a large number of people to take mortgages. If the interest rates recover, a TFSA could save home-owners who are facing unexpected increase in the payments for their home.\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [The Globe and Mail, *TFSA move targets savvy investors*, 2009](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/tfsa-move-targets-savvy-investors/article4215495/)  \r\n[2] [The Globe and Mail, *Taxman may forgive TFSA rule breakers*, 2010](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxman-may-forgive-tfsa-rule-breakers/article1373287/)  \r\n[3] [CBC, *Doubling TFSA limit will only help wealthy, study argues*, 2015](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doubling-tfsa-limit-will-only-help-wealthy-study-argues-1.2967796)",

Originally the account allowed for contributions of up to $5,000 per year. \r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Government**: The Government wants to provide incentive for Canadians to save money. At the same time it has to balance the budget and ensure that no group of Canadians are unfairly benefiting from the regulations. \r\n - **Banks**: Banks benefit by holding TFSA deposits because the rules of this account discourage Canadians from withdrawing money on a regular basis. When money is withdrawn from a TFSA account, the contribution room is not freed up until the following year. By having longer-term accounts banks can invest the funds in lucrative mortgages or credit card offers, while giving only a negligible portion of the earnings as interest back to the TFSA account holder.\r\n - **Average Canadians**: The average working class Canadian benefits from TFSA accounts by means of tax-free interest and incentive to keep healthy financial discipline.\r\n - **Savvy investors and traders**: Savvy investors and traders are able to exploit the full potential of a TFSA. The TFSA is a very flexible investment vehicle, particularly if used as a \"self-directed account\". The self-directed accounts can hold a large variety of securities and financial instruments, similar to RRSP accounts. The few exclusions relate to shares in companies of which the TFSA account holder has controlling role. Savvy individuals with access to highly lucrative investments have a virtually unlimited potential to earn tax-free income by re-investing earnings within the TFSA account.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Unfair advantages ##\r\n**Tax avoidance**. When the TFSA was first introduced, savvy investors and traders took advantage of the weak penalties for over-contribution and unqualified investments. The original penalty for over contribution was only 1% per month (and only on the over-contributions). Wealthy investors with access to investments with high returns were over-contributing $100,000 or more, paying the 1% penalty and still keeping all returns as tax-free income. Furthermore, initially the penalty for purchasing prohibited investments inside a TFSA (such as the shares of a company you control) was simply forfeiting the purchase. This means that investors with questionable morality were allowed to keep any capital gains resulting from prohibited investments, without paying tax[1].\r\nWhile the rules have since changed to prevent the most obvious tax avoidance schemes, questions still remain about what other opportunities for abuse are being exploited.\r\n\r\n**Unequal opportunities**. In 2010 big banks held 75% of Tax-Free Savings Accounts[2]. That is to say, 75% of accounts were giving their owners only the marginal interest rate that the big banks offer. At the same time, the remaining 25% of TFSAs were self-directed or held by other institutions, offering lucrative investments with limitless tax exemption to those in the know. In 2012, less than 16% of TFSA account holders under 60 years old had reached the $5,500 contribution limit[3]. I.e., only 16% of the economically active Canadian residents with TFSA accounts have enough spare income to reach the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit. If the limit is doubled, then, fewer than 16% of working Canadians will be able to benefit from this tax-break.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Loss of tax income**.

In 2011, oilsands operators used about 170 million cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to the amount of water used by 1.7 million Canadians [2].  This demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2020 [1].\r\n\r\nSurface water that is taken for oilsands extraction cannot be returned because of the toxins in the waste water.  Some water can be recycled within the extraction process, but ultimately, the water taken in ends up as waste water which has to be stored in tailings ponds or injected deep underground [2].\r\n\r\nIn Alberta\u2019s north, water is abundant and demand is still ``relatively low''. But in the southern portion of the province, demand is straining the existing allocation regime and the ecology.   The southern basin is now closed to granting new surface water licenses [3].\r\nAverage discharge from lower Athabasca River's mouth into Lake Athabasca during low-flow periods was 30% less in 1996-2006 than it was in 1966-1976 [2].  Flow downstream of Fort McMurray is predicted to decrease by 30 per cent by 2050, due to the combined impacts of climate change and industrial water withdrawals [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nWater withdrawals during winter low-flow periods risk reducing the availability of fish habitat [1]. Reduction of water flow can destroy the conditions needed for viability of and developing embryos of aquatic species in the river [1]. Even a couple inches in water levels can be critical, said Schindler. [1]\r\n\r\nThe Athabasca River is used extensively by about 1000 people from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  According to Chief Allan Adam [1]: \"When we hit low water levels, a lot of our people won't even be able to get into their traditional territory.\".\r\n\r\nAbout three-quarters of the Chipewyan people are on the river several times a week [1].\r\nAdam's band has filed for a judicial review of a land-use plan for the area that includes the water-use framework [1].\r\n\r\nIn addition to affecting water levels, there is evidence that, despite the fact that water drawn from the river is not returned, industrial activity is nevertheless introducing harmful chemicals into the Athabasca River.\r\nIndependent research suggests concentrations of dissolved polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) are higher downstream of oilsands development, in comparison to upstream, in tributaries to the Athabasca [2]. \r\nThis trend is more pronounced in the summer than in the winter [2].\r\nIndependent research has also found that sediment of lakes in the oilsands region (including one lake approximately 90 kilometres from the major development area) contain between 2.5 and 23 times higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than they did 50 years ago, before the industrial development of the oilsands began [2].\r\n\r\nThe draft water management framework recently released by the government of Alberta would regulate how much water can be removed at different times of the year [1].\r\nIts measures are expected to be implemented by fall 2015 [1].\r\nAt all times, total withdrawals would be a ``small fraction'' of the river's flow and would nearly stop when the Athabasca was flowing at its lowest rate [1].\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no research to suggest that the specific levels of withdrawals prescribed by the new water framework are compatible with the river ecosystem [1].\r\nThe framework is being heavily criticized as lacking a scientific foundation [1].\r\nThe framework does not include studies of the impacts to fish, insects, and other organisms, nor effects on water quality [1].\r\n\r\nAndy Ridge, director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, acknowledges that empirical data is scarce in the drafted framework [1].\r\nInstead, the framework relies on computer modelling to supplement the lack of empirical data [1].\r\nThis corroborates the 2011 findings of Environment Canada and a team of independent experts, who concluded that the current water monitoring system for the Athabasca region ``did not deliver data of sufficient quantity or quality to detect or quantify the effects of oilsands development.'' [2].\r\n\r\nThe existing water management policies require industrial operators to preferentially use brackish or saline groundwater, only turning to fresh groundwater when other sources do not suffice, and lastly to use fresh surface water [3].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Economic impacts ##\r\n**Realistic and enforceable regulations.** Water usage regulations, as with any regulations, should be consistent with economic and technological constraints.  All other things being equal, more restrictive regulations lead to higher costs in petroleum extraction.  On the other hand, regulations can help create the impetus for technological innovation, which may lead to more efficient and cost-effective approaches in the long-run.\r\n\r\n## Environmental impacts.##\r\n**Ecological damage.** The use of water from the Athabasca river by oilsands operators may cause serious ecological damage.  The lack of scientific research on these effects means that the trade off between economic gains and ecological damages are unknown.  This condition of uncertainty it is likely to lead to greater ecological damage than would arise if the ecological damages were understood. \r\n\r\n## Social ##\r\n**Disturbance to local people.** The Athabasca river is a source of livelihood for the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n## Health ##\r\n**Concerns for the health of local people.** The observation of hydrocarbon chemicals raises serious concerns about the health effects for people relying on the Athabasca river, including the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n- In CAPP\u2019s 2013 Crude Oil Forecast, oil sands production is projected to rise to 5.2 million bpd in 2030 from 1.8 million bpd in 2012.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CTV News, *Alberta's plan for Athabasca River 'pathetic,' not science-based: critics*](http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/alberta-s-plan-for-athabasca-river-pathetic-not-science-based-critics-1.1735778)  \r\n[2] [Pembina Institute, *Water Impacts*, 2013](http://www.pembina.org/oil-sands/os101/water#footnote3_iuh07fc)  \r\n[3] [Alberta Oil, *Alberta desperately needs a water-management plan*, 2013](http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/07/alberta-and-the-life-aquatic/)",

If the interest rates recover, a TFSA could save home-owners who are facing unexpected increase in the payments for their home.\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [The Globe and Mail, *TFSA move targets savvy investors*, 2009](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/tfsa-move-targets-savvy-investors/article4215495/)  \r\n[2] [The Globe and Mail, *Taxman may forgive TFSA rule breakers*, 2010](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxman-may-forgive-tfsa-rule-breakers/article1373287/)  \r\n[3] [CBC, *Doubling TFSA limit will only help wealthy, study argues*, 2015](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doubling-tfsa-limit-will-only-help-wealthy-study-argues-1.2967796)",

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n - **Andy Ridge**: director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development.\r\n - **The Alberta Water Council**: acts as an advisory board bringing stakeholders and experts together to oversee the implementation of water management strategies.\r\n - **Allan Adams**: Chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  The Chipewyan First Nation uses the Athabasca river extensively, and is affected by water usage practices by industry.\r\n - **Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)**: the interest group representing the oilsands industry in Canada.\r\n - **Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI)** -- six oilsands companies that have initiated and advanced several improvements to water management practices.  Includes Suncor Energy Inc, ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Shell Canada Ltd., Statoil Canada and Total E+P Canada Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\nIn December 2014, the government of Alberta distributed a draft surface water management framework for the Lower Athabasca River to industry, interest groups and First Nations [1].\r\n\r\nMost of the water used for extraction of petroleum from the Albertan oilsands is taken from the Athabasca River [2].  In 2011, oilsands operators used about 170 million cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to the amount of water used by 1.7 million Canadians [2].  This demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2020 [1].\r\n\r\nSurface water that is taken for oilsands extraction cannot be returned because of the toxins in the waste water.  Water can be recycled within the extraction process to an extent, but ultimately, water used in extraction ends up as waste water which has to be stored in tailings ponds or injected deep underground [2].\r\n\r\nIn Alberta's north, water is abundant and demand is still \"relatively low\". But in the southern portion of the province, demand is straining the existing allocation regime and the ecology.   The southern basin is now closed to granting new surface water licenses [3].\r\nAverage discharge from lower Athabasca River's mouth into Lake Athabasca during low-flow periods was 30% less in 1996-2006 than it was in 1966-1976 [2].  Flow downstream of Fort McMurray is predicted to decrease by 30 per cent by 2050, due to the combined impacts of climate change and industrial water withdrawals [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nWater withdrawals during winter low-flow periods risk reducing the availability of fish habitat [1]. Reduction of water flow can destroy the conditions needed for viability of and developing embryos of aquatic species in the river [1]. According to one scientist (David Schindler) even a couple inches in water levels can be critical [1].\r\n\r\nThe Athabasca River is used extensively by about 1000 people from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  According to Chief Allan Adam [1]: \"When we hit low water levels, a lot of our people won't even be able to get into their traditional territory.\".\r\n\r\nAbout three-quarters of the Chipewyan people use the river several times a week [1].\r\nAdam's band has filed for a judicial review of a land-use plan for the area that includes the proposed water-use framework [1].\r\n\r\nIn addition to affecting water levels, there is evidence that, industrial activity is introducing harmful chemicals into the Athabasca River.\r\nIndependent research suggests concentrations of dissolved polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) are higher downstream of oilsands development, in comparison to upstream, in tributaries to the Athabasca [2]. \r\nThis trend is more pronounced in the summer than in the winter [2].\r\nIndependent research has also found that sediment of lakes in the oilsands region (including one lake approximately 90 kilometres from the major development area) contain between 2.5 and 23 times higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than they did 50 years ago, before the industrial development of the oilsands began [2].\r\n\r\nThe draft water management framework recently released by the government of Alberta would regulate how much water can be removed at different times of the year [1].\r\nIts measures are expected to be implemented by fall 2015 [1].\r\nAt all times, total withdrawals would be a \"small fraction\" of the river's flow and would nearly stop when the Athabasca was flowing at its lowest rate [1].\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no research to suggest that the specific levels of withdrawals prescribed by the new water framework are compatible with the river ecosystem [1].\r\nThe framework is being heavily criticized as lacking a scientific foundation [1].\r\nThe framework does not include studies of the impacts to fish, insects, and other organisms, nor effects on water quality [1].\r\n\r\nAndy Ridge, director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, acknowledges that empirical data is scarce in the drafted framework [1].\r\nInstead, the framework relies on computer modeling to supplement the lack of empirical data [1].\r\nThis corroborates the 2011 findings of Environment Canada and a team of independent experts, who concluded that the current water monitoring system for the Athabasca region \"did not deliver data of sufficient quantity or quality to detect or quantify the effects of oilsands development.\" [2].\r\n\r\nThe existing water management policies do require industrial operators to preferentially use brackish or saline groundwater, only turning to fresh groundwater when other sources do not suffice, and lastly to use fresh surface water [3].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Economic impacts ##\r\n**Realistic and enforceable regulations.** Water usage regulations, as with any regulations, should be consistent with economic and technological constraints.  All other things being equal, more restrictive regulations lead to higher costs in petroleum extraction.  On the other hand, regulations can help create the impetus for technological innovation, which may lead to more efficient and cost-effective approaches in the long-run.\r\n\r\n## Environmental impacts.##\r\n**Ecological damage.** The use of water from the Athabasca river by oilsands operators may cause serious ecological damage.  The lack of scientific research on these effects means that the trade off between economic gains and ecological damages are unknown.  This condition of uncertainty it is likely to lead to greater ecological damages, since they are going unmonitored. \r\n\r\n## Social ##\r\n**Disturbance to local people.** The Athabasca river is a source of livelihood for the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n## Health ##\r\n**Concerns for the health of local people.** The observation of hydrocarbons raises serious concerns about the health effects for people relying on the Athabasca River, including the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n- In CAPP\u2019s 2013 Crude Oil Forecast, oil sands production is projected to rise to 5.2 million bpd in 2030 from 1.8 million bpd in 2012.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CTV News, *Alberta's plan for Athabasca River 'pathetic,' not science-based: critics*](http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/alberta-s-plan-for-athabasca-river-pathetic-not-science-based-critics-1.1735778)  \r\n[2] [Pembina Institute, *Water Impacts*, 2013](http://www.pembina.org/oil-sands/os101/water#footnote3_iuh07fc)  \r\n[3] [Alberta Oil, *Alberta desperately needs a water-management plan*, 2013](http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/07/alberta-and-the-life-aquatic/)",

ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  Furthermore, the militias that the US had armed and allied with to defeat Saddam Hussein were themselves brutal warlards, who, after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda.  Seeking to create an Islamic state in Iraq, instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there.  Currently it occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].  ISIS seeks to take over Iraq and Syria to create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Koran. [3]\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between them [10].  Many of the opposition forces fighting Assad and ISIS are almost as brutal: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Meanwhile, the crimes against humanity committed by Assad's regime arguably surpass even ISIS itself [10].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero.\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The first six months of deployment cost CAD$ 122 M.\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies except the US.  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\ninti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria. \r\n\r\n## Actors ##\r\n*[Note these are the decision makers relative to Canada's involvement, not the many players in the complex situation in Syria.

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n\r\n - **Prime minister of Canada**, Stephen Harper -- is in favor of further involvement in fighting ISIS\r\n - **Leader of the Official Opposition**, Thomas Mulcair -- believes that we should preferentially spend resources on humanitarian relief, to feed, clothe, and accept refugees, rather than attack ISIS.\r\n - **President of Syria**, Bashar Al-Assad -- tacitly supports western involvement by allowing the US to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria for six months without confrontation [8].\r\n - **President of the United States**, Barack Obama -- is leading the fight against ISIS, backed by several Western and Arab allies, including Canada.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Relations ##\r\nThere is a sense of responsibility to join with our allies in fighting ISIS.  ISIS is universally seen as the most violent and menacing group in the conflict, and there is a general sense that ISIS must be resisted by countries who have the means.  If Canada were to choose not to engage, it would likely be construed as a neglect of moral duty and a failure to follow through on Canada's commitments to its allies.\r\n\r\n## Impacts in Syria ##\r\nWhile the expansion of ISIS surely leads to enormous atrocity, there is no clear path to stability in these areas.    If ISIS is significantly degraded, it is reasonable to expect that the total amount of violence against civilians would be reduced.  However, the other groups in the region, who vie for power, are almost equally brutal, so it is not entirely clear attacking ISIS in Syria will be of significant benefit to Syrians.\r\n\r\n## Readiness ##\r\n**Security.** Intervening in this conflict may not be likely to bring it any closer to solution, but it does create new enemies.  By engaging ISIS, Canada becomes a potential target for acts of terrorism.\r\n\r\n## Economic ##\r\nCanada's resources, especially militarily, are limited.  A recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office, finds that the current defense program cannot be sustained without increasing the military budget from 1.1% of GDP (CAD$ 21.5 B) to 1.6% [9].  It is not clear that Canada's investment in fighting ISIS will have a substantial positive impact, which calls to question whether this spending is justified.\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\n## ISIS ##\r\n**Origins.** ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, also goes by the names ISIL, the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, and simply IS, Islamic State.  ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  During the war in Iraq, the US had armed militias to help overthrow Saddam Hussein.  After Saddam Hussein was removed, the militias turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to create an Islamic state in Iraq.  Instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there, and now ISIS seeks to take over both Iraq and Syria and create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].  ISIS occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].a\r\n\r\n**Identity.** ISIS proclaims that it represents Muslims of the world.  In fact, they are shunned by the vast majority of Muslims.  Their identification with Islam is the basis for their legitimacy internally and is used to recruit and radicalize new members.  They use this identity to claim that their enemies have declared war on Islam.\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between rebel groups [10].  The result is a civil without any clear polarity.\r\n\r\nMany of the opposition forces fighting Assad's regime are similar in their brutality: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Fighting amongst rebel groups, and between rebel groups and the Syrian government, has caused Syria to descend into chaotic, ungoverned war zone.\r\n\r\nThis context of instability provides an opportunity to ISIS, to seize territory in Syria and challenge the Syrian government and maligned rebels.  The atrocities commited by ISIS are considered to be the worst, but by some accounts Assad's regime arguably surpasses even ISIS itself [10].  The civil war in Syria has cost tens of thousands of lives [2].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision to enter.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero [8].\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The first six months of deployment has cost CAD$ 122 M [8].\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies except the US.  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\nanti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria.\r\n\r\n## Prognosis ##\r\nUS officials believe the confrontation with ISIS will be a multi-year compaign [3].  The Canadian government's plan has been criticised for a lack of any clear end-game.  It is not clear what it means to \"degrade\" ISIS, nor how to determine when enough degradation has occurred and when to disengage [5].  As the coalition becomes involved in Syria, they might become increasingly committed, since ceasing involvement would cause a severe shift in the power balance within the conflict, and could have immediate visible consequences to human life.  \r\n\r\nEven if ISIS forces are substantiall degraded, there is little reason to believe that the people in Syria will be better off, since power and territory is inevitably transferred from ISIS to the Syrian government and rebel forces [7]. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that, by degrading ISIS forces, the amount of violence inflicted overall in the conflict will be lessened [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n## The case for intervention ##\r\nSome people argue that earlier intervention in Iraq and Syria could have avoided such a decline to chaos that enabled ISIS to flourish [2].  However past interventions, such as in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, suggest that there is a consistent pattern of failure in executing interventions [6].  The pattern appears to follow this course [6]: an existing power structure or military agent is identified as being the primary obstacle to freedom and prosperity.  Oppression under this agent has given rise to diverse armed opposition groups that seek to remove the existing structure.  External (Western) forces intervene, and the primary power structure is removed, usually with the help of armed opposition groups.  Once the old power structure is overturned, some of the opposition groups try to step into power.  These groups, being militias, are ill-equipped for the task of governance, which is, of course, completely different from waging of armed warfare.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of civic institutions needed for a functioning democracy [11].  Even when the external agents attempt to scaffold the development of institutions of governance, they are ineffective [11].  The result is the substitution for a regime that is equally oppressive, or a descent into permanent warfare, as various opposition forces vie for power [6].\r\n\r\nWhile the conflict in Syria matches this schema to a degree, in this case, the proposed intervention is *not* to remove an established power structure, but rather, to degrade the encroachment of a violent group that aspires to power, ISIS. Despite the fact that Canada and the US have called for Bashar Al-Assad to resign, the Canadian government has no plan to remove Bashar Al-Assad [1], nor participate in the Syrian conflict in any way other than to assist with strategic attacks on ISIS [1].\r\n\r\nThus, Canadian involvement is strictly to combat, in a highly targeted way, an armed group that is committing terrible crimes against humanity [1].  Given what ISIS is currently doing, and Canada's ability to intervene with airstrikes, it is argued that there is a strong moral imperative to engage.  Furthermore, the Canadian government feels strong pressure from other members of NATO to stay involved and make proportionate contributions to the coalition effort, which is viewed as a humanitarian obligation.\r\n\r\n## Threats of terrorism on Canadian soil ##\r\nThere have been two attacks on Canadian soldiers while in Canada, at least one of which was directly supported by ISIS recruiting [2].  There is concern that fighting ISIS could make Canada a target for terrorist activities.  Shortly after joining the coalition effort to fight ISIS, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and specifically named Canada.  A number of Canadians are known to be fighting with ISIS, and many are currently trying to go to fight [2].\r\n\r\nHowever, these fears are probably not justified by the actual risks, which, in Canada, are negligible when compared to those directly involved in the conflict.  In 2013, considering all Western nations, there were 12 victims of terror attacks, compared to 22,000 non-Western fatalities, *excluding attacks by the Syrian government on its own people and civilians killed by warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan* [7].\r\n\r\n",

It is not clear that Canada's investment in fighting ISIS will have a substantial positive impact, which calls to question whether this spending is justified.\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\n## ISIS ##\r\n**Origins.** ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, also goes by the names ISIL, the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, and simply IS, Islamic State.  ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  During the war in Iraq, the US had armed militias to help overthrow Saddam Hussein.  After Saddam Hussein was removed, the militias turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to create an Islamic state in Iraq.  Instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there, and now ISIS seeks to take over both Iraq and Syria and create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].  ISIS occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].\r\n\r\n**Identity.** ISIS proclaims that it represents Muslims of the world.  In fact, ISIS is shunned by the vast majority of people of all religious affiliations, including Muslims in particular.  Their identification with Islam provides an internal basis for legitimacy, and is used to recruit and radicalize new members.  They use this identification to claim that their enemies have declared war on Islam.\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between rebel groups [10].  The result is a civil without any clear polarity.\r\n\r\nMany of the opposition forces fighting Assad's regime are similar in their brutality: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Fighting amongst rebel groups, and between rebel groups and the Syrian government, has caused Syria to descend into chaotic, ungoverned war zone.\r\n\r\nThis context of instability provides an opportunity to ISIS, to seize territory in Syria and challenge the Syrian government and maligned rebels.  The atrocities commited by ISIS are considered to be the worst, but by some accounts Assad's regime arguably surpasses even ISIS itself [10].  The civil war in Syria has cost tens of thousands of lives [2].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision to enter.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov 2014, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero [8].\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The first six months of deployment has cost CAD$ 122 M [8].\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies (except the US).  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\nanti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria, whereas previously operations were confined to Iraq.\r\n\r\n## Prognosis ##\r\nUS officials believe the confrontation with ISIS will be a multi-year compaign [3].  The Canadian government's plan has been criticized internally for a lack of any clear endpoint.  It is not clear what it means to \"degrade\" ISIS, nor how to determine when enough degradation has occurred and when to disengage [5].  As the coalition becomes involved in Syria, it might become increasingly committed, since its presence becomes an important contribution to the balance of power, the removal of which could have immediate and visible consequences to human life.  \r\n\r\nEven if ISIS forces are substantially degraded, the people in Syria may not be better off, since power and territory is inevitably transferred from ISIS to the Syrian government and rebel forces [7]. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that, by degrading ISIS forces, the amount of violence inflicted overall in the conflict will be lessened [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n## The case for intervention ##\r\nSome people argue that if the recent intervention in Iraq and Syria had been made earlier, it could have avoided such a decline to chaos that enabled ISIS to flourish [2].  However past interventions, such as in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, point to a consistent pattern of poor outcomes when intervening in similar circumstances [6].  The pattern appears to follow this course [6]: an existing power structure or military agent is identified as being the primary obstacle to freedom and prosperity.  Before intervening, oppression under this agent has given rise to diverse armed opposition groups that seek to remove the existing structure.  External (Western) forces intervene, and the primary power structure is removed, usually with the help of armed opposition groups.  Once the old power structure is overturned, some of the opposition groups try to step into power.  These groups are ill-equipped for the task of governance, which is, of course, completely different from waging of armed warfare.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of civic institutions and needed for a functioning democracy [11].  Even when the external agents attempt to scaffold the development of institutions of governance, they are ineffective [11].  The result is a substitution for a regime that is equally oppressive, or a descent into chronic warfare, as various opposition forces vie for power [6].\r\n\r\nWhile the conflict in Syria matches this schema to a degree, in this case, the proposed intervention is *not* to remove an established power structure, but rather, to degrade an encroaching violent group that aspires to power, ISIS. Despite the fact that Canada and the US have called for Bashar Al-Assad to resign, the Canadian government has no plan to remove Bashar Al-Assad [1], nor to participate in the Syrian conflict in any way other than to assist with strategic attacks on ISIS [1].\r\n\r\nThus, Canadian involvement is strictly to combat, in a highly targeted way, an armed group that is committing terrible crimes against humanity [1].  Given what ISIS is currently doing, and Canada's ability to intervene with airstrikes, it is argued that there is a strong moral imperative to engage.  Furthermore, the Canadian government feels strong pressure from other members of NATO to stay involved and make proportionate contributions to the coalition effort, which is viewed as a humanitarian obligation.\r\n\r\n## Threats of terrorism on Canadian soil ##\r\nThere have been two attacks on Canadian soldiers while in Canada, at least one of which was directly supported by ISIS recruiting [2].  There is concern that fighting ISIS could make Canada a target for terrorist activities.  Shortly after joining the coalition effort to fight ISIS, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and specifically named Canada.  A number of Canadians are known to be fighting with ISIS, and many are currently trying to go to fight [2].\r\n\r\nHowever, these fears are probably not justified by the actual risks, which, in Canada, are negligible when compared to those directly involved in the conflict.  In 2013, considering all Western nations, there were 12 victims of terror attacks, compared to 22,000 non-Western fatalities, *excluding attacks by the Syrian government on its own people and civilians killed by warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan* [7].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC, *Canada is at war with ISIS, not Syria, Stephen Harper says*, 14 Nov \r\n    2014](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-is-at-war-with-isis-not-syria-stephen-harper-says-1.2834871)  \r\n[2] [CBC, *Should the West stop intervening in the Middle East?*, 24 Oct 2014](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/should-the-west-stop-intervening-in-the-middle-east-1.2811177)  \r\n[3] [CBC, *Canada's forces face daunting mission against ISIS in Iraq*, 2 Nov 2014](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-s-forces-face-daunting-mission-against-isis-in-iraq-1.2821390)  \r\n[4] *[Duplicate reference removed]* \r\n[5] [Globe and Mail, *'Moral clarity' aside, Canada's Syria mission lacks an endgame*, 28 March 2015](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-is-wading-into-murky-territory-with-moral-clarity-argument/article23676865/)  \r\n[6] [Globe and Mail, *The expanded Iraq mission is an immoral misadventure*, 27 March 2015](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/the-expanded-iraq-mission-is-an-immoral-misadventure/article23665816/)  \r\n[7] [Maclean's, *How the Muslim world is being left behind*, 14 January 2015](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/why-muslim-world-decline/)  \r\n[8] [Globe and Mail, *Tories say waging war on Islamic State is a humanitarian effort*, 26 March 2015](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/waging-war-on-islamic-state-necessary-part-of-humanitarian-response-tories-say/article23631702/)  \r\n[9] [Globe and Mail, *Ottawa\u2019s defence costs \u2018unsustainable\u2019 over next decade, budget watchdog says*, 26 March 2015](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawas-defence-costs-unsustainable-over-next-decade-budget-watchdog-says/article23630687/)  \r\n[10] [CBC, *Is Canada's ISIS mission ready for Syria's moral maze?*, 30 March 215](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/is-canada-s-isis-mission-ready-for-syria-s-moral-maze-1.3013094)  ",

However, the other groups in the region, who vie for power, are almost equally brutal, so attacking ISIS in Syria may not be of significant benefit to Syrians.\r\n\r\n## Readiness ##\r\n**Security.** By engaging ISIS, Canada may become a potential target for acts of terrorism.\r\n\r\n## Economic ##\r\nA recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office, finds that the current defense program cannot be sustained without increasing the military budget from 1.1% of GDP (CAD$ 21.5 B) to 1.6% [9].  It is not clear that Canada's investment in fighting ISIS will have a substantial positive impact, which calls to question whether this spending is justified.\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\n## ISIS ##\r\n**Origins.** ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, also goes by the names ISIL, the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, and simply IS, Islamic State.  ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  During the war in Iraq, the US had armed militias to help overthrow Saddam Hussein.  After Saddam Hussein was removed, the militias turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to create an Islamic state in Iraq.  Instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there, and now ISIS seeks to take over both Iraq and Syria and create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].  ISIS occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].\r\n\r\n**Identity.** ISIS proclaims that it represents Muslims of the world.  In fact, ISIS is shunned by the vast majority of people of all religious affiliations, including Muslims in particular.  Their identification with Islam provides an internal basis for legitimacy, and is used to recruit and radicalize new members.  They use this identification to claim that their enemies have declared war on Islam.\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between rebel groups [10].  The result is a civil without any clear polarity.\r\n\r\nMany of the opposition forces fighting Assad's regime are similar in their brutality: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Fighting amongst rebel groups, and between rebel groups and the Syrian government, has caused Syria to descend into chaotic, ungoverned war zone.\r\n\r\nThis context of instability provides an opportunity to ISIS, to seize territory in Syria and challenge the Syrian government and maligned rebels.  The atrocities commited by ISIS are considered to be the worst, but by some accounts Assad's regime arguably surpasses even ISIS itself [10].  The civil war in Syria has cost tens of thousands of lives [2].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision to enter.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov 2014, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero [8].\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The first six months of deployment has cost CAD$ 122 M [8].\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies (except the US).  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\nanti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria, whereas previously operations were confined to Iraq.\r\n\r\n## Prognosis ##\r\nUS officials believe the confrontation with ISIS will be a multi-year compaign [3].  The Canadian government's plan has been criticized internally for a lack of any clear endpoint.  It is not clear what it means to \"degrade\" ISIS, nor how to determine when enough degradation has occurred and when to disengage [5].  As the coalition becomes involved in Syria, it might become increasingly committed, since its presence becomes an important contribution to the balance of power, the removal of which could have immediate and visible consequences to human life.  \r\n\r\nEven if ISIS forces are substantially degraded, the people in Syria may not be better off, since power and territory is inevitably transferred from ISIS to the Syrian government and rebel forces [7]. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that, by degrading ISIS forces, the amount of violence inflicted overall in the conflict will be lessened [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n## The case for intervention ##\r\nSome people argue that if the recent intervention in Iraq and Syria had been made earlier, it could have avoided such a decline to chaos that enabled ISIS to flourish [2].  However past interventions, such as in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, point to a consistent pattern of poor outcomes when intervening in similar circumstances [6].  The pattern appears to follow this course [6]: an existing power structure or military agent is identified as being the primary obstacle to freedom and prosperity.  Before intervening, oppression under this agent has given rise to diverse armed opposition groups that seek to remove the existing structure.  External (Western) forces intervene, and the primary power structure is removed, usually with the help of armed opposition groups.  Once the old power structure is overturned, some of the opposition groups try to step into power.  These groups are ill-equipped for the task of governance, which is, of course, completely different from waging of armed warfare.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of civic institutions and needed for a functioning democracy [11].  Even when the external agents attempt to scaffold the development of institutions of governance, they are ineffective [11].  The result is a substitution for a regime that is equally oppressive, or a descent into chronic warfare, as various opposition forces vie for power [6].\r\n\r\nWhile the conflict in Syria matches this schema to a degree, in this case, the proposed intervention is *not* to remove an established power structure, but rather, to degrade an encroaching violent group that aspires to power, ISIS. Despite the fact that Canada and the US have called for Bashar Al-Assad to resign, the Canadian government has no plan to remove Bashar Al-Assad [1], nor to participate in the Syrian conflict in any way other than to assist with strategic attacks on ISIS [1].\r\n\r\nThus, Canadian involvement is strictly to combat, in a highly targeted way, an armed group that is committing terrible crimes against humanity [1].  Given what ISIS is currently doing, and Canada's ability to intervene with airstrikes, it is argued that there is a strong moral imperative to engage.  Furthermore, the Canadian government feels strong pressure from other members of NATO to stay involved and make proportionate contributions to the coalition effort, which is viewed as a humanitarian obligation.\r\n\r\n## Threats of terrorism on Canadian soil ##\r\nThere have been two attacks on Canadian soldiers while in Canada, at least one of which was directly supported by ISIS recruiting [2].  There is concern that fighting ISIS could make Canada a target for terrorist activities.  Shortly after joining the coalition effort to fight ISIS, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and specifically named Canada.  A number of Canadians are known to be fighting with ISIS, and many are currently trying to go to fight [2].\r\n\r\nHowever, these fears are probably not justified by the actual risks, which, in Canada, are negligible when compared to those directly involved in the conflict.  In 2013, considering all Western nations, there were 12 victims of terror attacks, compared to 22,000 non-Western fatalities, *excluding attacks by the Syrian government on its own people and civilians killed by warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan* [7].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n 1.

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n\r\n - **Prime minister of Canada**, Stephen Harper -- is in favor of further involvement in fighting ISIS, and expanding current operations to Syria [1].\r\n - **Leader of the Official Opposition**, Thomas Mulcair -- believes that we should preferentially spend resources on humanitarian relief, to feed, clothe, and accept refugees, rather than attack ISIS [8].\r\n - **President of the United States**, Barack Obama -- is leading the fight against ISIS, backed by several Western and Arab allies, including Canada.\r\n - **President of Syria**, Bashar Al-Assad -- tacitly supports western involvement by allowing the US to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria for six months without confrontation [8].\r\n - **ISIS**, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (also ISIL, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and IS, Islamic State) -- a violent splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to take over Syria and Iraq to create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Relations ##\r\nISIS is universally seen as the most violent and menacing group in the conflict in Syria, and there is a general sense that ISIS must be resisted by countries who have the means.  If Canada were to choose not to engage, it would likely be construed as a neglect of moral duty and a failure to follow through on Canada's commitments to its allies.\r\n\r\n## Impacts in Syria ##\r\nWhile the expansion of ISIS surely leads to enormous atrocity, there is no clear path to stability in these areas.  If ISIS is significantly degraded, it is reasonable to expect that the total amount of violence against civilians would be reduced.  However, the other groups in the region, who vie for power, are almost equally brutal, so attacking ISIS in Syria may not be of significant benefit to Syrians.\r\n\r\n## Readiness ##\r\n**Security.** By engaging ISIS, Canada may become a potential target for acts of terrorism.\r\n\r\n## Economic ##\r\nA recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office, finds that the current defense program cannot be sustained without increasing the military budget from 1.1% of GDP (CAD$ 21.5 B) to 1.6% [9].  It is not clear that Canada's investment in fighting ISIS will have a substantial positive impact, which calls to question whether this spending is justified.\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\n## ISIS ##\r\n**Origins.** ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, also goes by the names ISIL, the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, and simply IS, Islamic State.  ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  During the war in Iraq, the US had armed militias to help overthrow Saddam Hussein.  After Saddam Hussein was removed, the militias turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to create an Islamic state in Iraq.  Instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there, and now ISIS seeks to take over both Iraq and Syria and create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].  ISIS occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].\r\n\r\n**Identity.** ISIS proclaims that it represents Muslims of the world.  In fact, ISIS is shunned by the vast majority of people of all religious affiliations, including Muslims in particular.  Their identification with Islam provides an internal basis for legitimacy, and is used to recruit and radicalize new members.  They use this identification to claim that their enemies have declared war on Islam.\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between rebel groups [10].  The result is a civil without any clear polarity.\r\n\r\nMany of the opposition forces fighting Assad's regime are similar in their brutality: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Fighting amongst rebel groups, and between rebel groups and the Syrian government, has caused Syria to descend into chaotic, ungoverned war zone.\r\n\r\nThis context of instability provides an opportunity to ISIS, to seize territory in Syria and challenge the Syrian government and maligned rebels.  The atrocities commited by ISIS are considered to be the worst, but by some accounts Assad's regime arguably surpasses even ISIS itself [10].  The civil war in Syria has cost tens of thousands of lives [2].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision to enter.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov 2014, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero [8].\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The mission has already costed CAD$ 122 M and it is expected to cost an additional $406 M for the next 12 months. Further extensions or the cost of shutting the mission down would be extra [12].\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies (except the US).  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\nanti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria, whereas previously operations were confined to Iraq.\r\n\r\n## Prognosis ##\r\nUS officials believe the confrontation with ISIS will be a multi-year compaign [3].  The Canadian government's plan has been criticized internally for a lack of any clear endpoint.  It is not clear what it means to \"degrade\" ISIS, nor how to determine when enough degradation has occurred and when to disengage [5].  As the coalition becomes involved in Syria, it might become increasingly committed, since its presence becomes an important contribution to the balance of power, the removal of which could have immediate and visible consequences to human life.  \r\n\r\nEven if ISIS forces are substantially degraded, the people in Syria may not be better off, since power and territory is inevitably transferred from ISIS to the Syrian government and rebel forces [7]. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that, by degrading ISIS forces, the amount of violence inflicted overall in the conflict will be lessened [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n## The case for intervention ##\r\nSome people argue that if the recent intervention in Iraq and Syria had been made earlier, it could have avoided such a decline to chaos that enabled ISIS to flourish [2].  However past interventions, such as in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, point to a consistent pattern of poor outcomes when intervening in similar circumstances [6].  The pattern appears to follow this course [6]: an existing power structure or military agent is identified as being the primary obstacle to freedom and prosperity.  Before intervening, oppression under this agent has given rise to diverse armed opposition groups that seek to remove the existing structure.  External (Western) forces intervene, and the primary power structure is removed, usually with the help of armed opposition groups.  Once the old power structure is overturned, some of the opposition groups try to step into power.  These groups are ill-equipped for the task of governance, which is, of course, completely different from waging of armed warfare.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of civic institutions and needed for a functioning democracy [11].  Even when the external agents attempt to scaffold the development of institutions of governance, they are ineffective [11].  The result is a substitution for a regime that is equally oppressive, or a descent into chronic warfare, as various opposition forces vie for power [6].\r\n\r\nWhile the conflict in Syria matches this schema to a degree, in this case, the proposed intervention is *not* to remove an established power structure, but rather, to degrade an encroaching violent group that aspires to power, ISIS. Despite the fact that Canada and the US have called for Bashar Al-Assad to resign, the Canadian government has no plan to remove Bashar Al-Assad [1], nor to participate in the Syrian conflict in any way other than to assist with strategic attacks on ISIS [1].\r\n\r\nThus, Canadian involvement is strictly to combat, in a highly targeted way, an armed group that is committing terrible crimes against humanity [1].  Given what ISIS is currently doing, and Canada's ability to intervene with airstrikes, it is argued that there is a strong moral imperative to engage.  Furthermore, the Canadian government feels strong pressure from other members of NATO to stay involved and make proportionate contributions to the coalition effort, which is viewed as a humanitarian obligation.\r\n\r\n## Threats of terrorism on Canadian soil ##\r\nThere have been two attacks on Canadian soldiers while in Canada, at least one of which was directly supported by ISIS recruiting [2].  There is concern that fighting ISIS could make Canada a target for terrorist activities.  Shortly after joining the coalition effort to fight ISIS, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and specifically named Canada.  A number of Canadians are known to be fighting with ISIS, and many are currently trying to go to fight [2].\r\n\r\nHowever, these fears are probably not justified by the actual risks, which, in Canada, are negligible when compared to those directly involved in the conflict.  In 2013, considering all Western nations, there were 12 victims of terror attacks, compared to 22,000 non-Western fatalities, *excluding attacks by the Syrian government on its own people and civilians killed by warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan* [7].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n 1.

    "title": "Keystone XL Pipeline Extension",
    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "title": "Net Neutrality",
    "text": "\r\n#Background#\r\nThe term Net Neutrality was originally coined by professor Tim Wu in 2003 (http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF). However, the debate on Net Neutrality was ongoing prior to that. Advocates for Net Neutrality are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network infrastructure to block or otherwise deteriorate access to content, services or websites which are competitors to, or deemed undesirable by, the ISP.\r\nCritics of Net Neutrality claim that network management is needed in order to ensure Quality of Service and to prioritize critical applications such as VoIP telephony or email, over less critical ones, like peer-to-peer networks.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Internet Service Providers**: Companies which connect retail customers to the Internet. Examples include Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Rogers, etc.\r\n - **Transit Service Providers**: Companies, sometimes ISPs or hosting providers, which interconnect ISPs. They are responsible for the backbone of the Internet. When content moves from a hosting provider to an ISP, the Transit Service Providers may collect fees. Examples include Cogent Communications, Hurricane Electric, Level 3 Communications, etc.\r\n - **Established Content Providers**: Include Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. These are large companies, responsible for the majority of content carried over the Internet.\r\n - **Government**: The Government can impose a law on ISPs, requiring Net Neutrality. The main interest of the government is to ensure fair access to content, while promoting economic activity.\r\n - **Alternative Content Providers**: Services like Vimeo, Mega, Popcorn Time and other emerging providers. They may be unable to enter in agreements with ISPs due to lack of funding or legal impediments.\r\n - **Internet Users**: Ordinary people want to maximize their access to content and connection quality, while keeping prices low.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Social Impacts ##\r\n**Content Monopoly**. Alternative content providers are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network to \u201clock-out\u201d competing services or those unable to enter into traffic shaping agreements.\r\n\r\n**Censorship**. Internet users are worry of the impact that control over access to content may have on democracy and freedoms.\r\n\r\n**Quality of Service**. Internet providers claim that some popular content providers cause saturation of the network and degrade the Internet service for all users. Some users are concerned that degraded network performance may impact essential communications services such as access to 911 over VoIP lines.\r\n\r\n**Inequality**. Some content providers claim that the design of Internet protocols already imposes inequality by favouring non time-sensitive applications, such as large file downloads, over real time services like VoIP or multiplayer games. They argue that network management techniques level the playing field for time-sensitive applications.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Internet Service Innovations**. ISPs are concerned that a few content providers utilize most of the available network bandwidth without paying a proportional access fee. Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon. It is debatable whether peering agreements are a violation of Net Neutrality, however they were reached in response to deteriorated performance of access to Netflix content over the ISPs\u2019 networks.

    "title": "Bill C-13, Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act",
    "text": "# Background #\r\nA central nominal goal of Bill C-13 is to criminalize cyberbullying [1], which the Canadian Bar Association identifies as an 'Obvious legislative \"gap\"' [1]. In order to collect data, authorities must suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the information will assist in the crime's investigation. \r\n\r\nThe bill establishes (in section 162.1) that sharing \"intimate images\" of a person, when the person in the image has not consented to the sharing, is an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.  Although the bill has been described (by Peter MacKay) as intended to protect children and youth from online predators, existing Criminal Code provisions (section 163.1 - Child Pornography) already criminalize the mere posession of such images, with harsher penalty.  Therefore, this bill only extends the provisions against the use of intimate images involving adults [1].\r\n\r\nSection 162.1 also does not establish the need for malicious intent.  This means that in a hypothetical situation where Mr. Smith lends his laptop to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith might be liable for having shared intimate images of him and his wife, even though they are in a deep folder marked \"private\", and he did not think that Mr. Jones would look there [1]. Other possibilities exist, and arise wording in section 162.1 which permits wide interpretation [1].  This also exposes the media, such as photojournalists, to criminal sanction for publishing compromising images of celebrities or politicians [1].\r\n\r\nThe Bar proposed other amendments to encourage a focus on cyberbullying and proportionate sentencing [1].  Further, they warn against excessive reliance on law to handle cyberbullying committed by youth, which may be less effective than education and other preventative measures [1]. \r\n\r\nBill C-13 goes far beyond cyberbullying, and instead describes provisions for the search and seizure of Internet Data, revisiting \"lawful access\" legislation, which has previously been controversial [1].  The Canadian Bar Association recommended splitting the Bill into two bills, one which addresses cyberbullying, and the other to address lawful access legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Association of the Bar acknowledges the concern of the Canadian Government, but has recommended that enhancements to state power which infringe on privacy should be coupled with effective oversight mechanisms. [1]\r\n\r\nSection 487.012 provides the power for police officers to make \"preservation demands\", without any judicial authorization, which requires a person to preserve (i.e. not delete) data, if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the data will assist in the investigation, or that a crime under any Foreign law has or will be committed.  In the case of crimes in Canada, preservation would be for 21 days, while for foreign laws, for 90 days.  The CBA recommended reducing these periods to only cover a reasonable amount of time needed to get judicial authorization, and that preservation demands should only be applicable for crimes according to foreign laws which would also be crimes in Canada.  The Act does not require written records to be kept. (CBA recommends this be required.)\r\n\r\nSubsection 5 of 487.012 gives officers the ability to impose unlimited conditions on preservation demands.  According to CBA, such conditions could prevent a party from exercising lawful rights, and such restrictions should only be imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe bill empowers judges to issue production orders for tracking data (such as GPS data), information identifying financial account holders, and the use of tracking devices, but with a lower threshold than previously existed -- \r\nonly requiring that the judge be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that on offense has or will be committed.\r\n\r\nSection 492.2 updates laws which enabled officers to obtain telephone metadata to allow law enforcement to install \"transmission data recorders\" to capture metadata related to any kind of telecommunications.  Because of the richness of digital telecommunications, this could identify far more detailed biographical information about the individual, and so is a materially more severe invasion of privacy.  Warrants to use a transmission data recorder also only need to be justified by reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that an offense has or will be committed.  Information that could be captured would include\r\n\r\n - the IP address of the originating computer and server (i.e. website) being communicated with\r\n - the computer program being used\r\n - the protocol being used (identifying whether the person is viewing a website, using videoconferencing, etc)\r\n - whether the transmission was completed\r\n\r\nThis would enable, for example, to tell whether a person had been communicating on a regular basis with a particular health professional, or accessing a particular online service.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n- CSEC\r\n- Government of Canada\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Culture ##\r\n- The criminalization of cyberbullying would enable law enforcement to take action against people committing cyberbullying, and might reduce its prevalence.u \r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] Commentary by the Canadian Bar Association ([pdf](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDQQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cba.org%2Fcba%2Fsubmissions%2Fpdf%2F14-33-eng.pdf&ei=Lk3cVJm9DoagNuCTgbAG&usg=AFQjCNHfIQ7iJmSssJ-kyhHJvOqwUoLRGg&sig2=A7dmQIKgYQnp9SzNteMAOw&bvm=bv.85761416,d.eXY))",

    "title": "Bill C-51 Anti-terrorism Act, 2015",
    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offence\" and \"Terrorist propaganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offences\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about bill C-51 have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propaganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offence [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorist propaganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a reasonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  Bill C-51 allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promotion\" of terrorism offences.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propaganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision [7].\r\nCurrently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) runs a program entitled Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5]. However, the criminalization of terrorist propaganda might interfere with the availability of intelligence that would occur naturally on social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP, who can then act on it.  Bill C-51 will give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offences, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists,\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack,\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nBill c-51 allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfil their mandates, and when it is a matter of national security [7].  Judges can order Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide identifying information of the sources of terrorist propaganda so that they may be located [4].  Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No-fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no-fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from travelling, or who are subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nBill C-51 lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no-fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from travelling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\nAllowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time, and will likely lead to more effective protection against terrorist activities [4].\r\n\r\nBy rendering the promotion/advocacy of terrorist propaganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence could be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. This could lead to less effective protection against terrorist activities [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\nBy lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-censorship or undue and unnecessary surveillance of those expressing political dissent [1].  The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to \"persecutory overreach\" [5].\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that protests and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada, or its economic or financial stability [6].  As an example, consider a demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\nMaterial considered to be \"terrorist propaganda\" could be partially removed from the Internet information normally accessible to Canadians.\r\nPolitical and artistic expression \"near the fringe\" may be self-censored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propaganda\" [1].\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty created by Bill C-51 may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, for example, as part of the CVE program, because those people might be more fearful of law enforcement [5]. \r\n\r\nThe wide interpretation of \"terrorism advocacy\" could hamper the freedom of expression.  Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\" [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - Existing legislation allows a judge to order the removal of \"hate propaganda\" and child pornography [1].\r\n - In the UK, in 2010, more than 65 000 pieces of unlawful terrorism-related content was removed, 80% of which was from jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria [1].\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked and/or removed. [1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order [1]. \r\n - In Australia, ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content, and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order [1].\r\n - Relative to France, the USA, Australia, and the UK, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation is \"less invasive\" [4].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC.

    "title": "Doubling TFSA contribution limits",
    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe TFSA account was first introduced in 2009 to encourage Canadians to save. Originally the account allowed for contributions of up to $5,000 per year. \r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Government**: The Government wants to provide incentive for Canadians to save money. At the same time it has to balance the budget and ensure that no group of Canadians are unfairly benefiting from the regulations. \r\n - **Banks**: Banks benefit by holding TFSA deposits because the rules of this account discourage Canadians from withdrawing money on a regular basis. When money is withdrawn from a TFSA account, the contribution room is not freed up until the following year. By having longer-term accounts banks can invest the funds in lucrative mortgages or credit card offers, while giving only a negligible portion of the earnings as interest back to the TFSA account holder.\r\n - **Average Canadians**: The average working class Canadian benefits from TFSA accounts by means of tax-free interest and incentive to keep healthy financial discipline.\r\n - **Savvy investors and traders**: Savvy investors and traders are able to exploit the full potential of a TFSA. The TFSA is a very flexible investment vehicle, particularly if used as a \"self-directed account\". The self-directed accounts can hold a large variety of securities and financial instruments, similar to RRSP accounts. The few exclusions relate to shares in companies of which the TFSA account holder has controlling role. Savvy individuals with access to highly lucrative investments have a virtually unlimited potential to earn tax-free income by re-investing earnings within the TFSA account.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Unfair advantages ##\r\n**Tax avoidance**. When the TFSA was first introduced, savvy investors and traders took advantage of the weak penalties for over-contribution and unqualified investments. The original penalty for over contribution was only 1% per month (and only on the over-contributions). Wealthy investors with access to investments with high returns were over-contributing $100,000 or more, paying the 1% penalty and still keeping all returns as tax-free income. Furthermore, initially the penalty for purchasing prohibited investments inside a TFSA (such as the shares of a company you control) was simply forfeiting the purchase. This means that investors with questionable morality were allowed to keep any capital gains resulting from prohibited investments, without paying tax[1].\r\nWhile the rules have since changed to prevent the most obvious tax avoidance schemes, questions still remain about what other opportunities for abuse are being exploited.\r\n\r\n**Unequal opportunities**. In 2010 big banks held 75% of Tax-Free Savings Accounts[2]. That is to say, 75% of accounts were giving their owners only the marginal interest rate that the big banks offer. At the same time, the remaining 25% of TFSAs were self-directed or held by other institutions, offering lucrative investments with limitless tax exemption to those in the know. In 2012, less than 16% of TFSA account holders under 60 years old had reached the $5,500 contribution limit[3]. I.e., only 16% of the economically active Canadian residents with TFSA accounts have enough spare income to reach the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit. If the limit is doubled, then, fewer than 16% of working Canadians will be able to benefit from this tax-break.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Loss of tax income**. By having no limits on the types of investments in a TFSA, the government in power leaves an unpredictable tax loss for future governments. The amount of tax wealthy investors and knowledgeable traders will not pay into future budgets depends only on their luck and skills. Doubling the contribution limit has cumulative impact on the tax loss, as any earnings can be re-invested freely.\r\n\r\n**Reduced economic activity**. Encouraging Canadians to invest up to $11,000 of their yearly income in a savings account and penalizing them (by means of lost contribution room) for withdrawals, may negatively impact local businesses as less money will be circulating in the economy. This will put deflationary pressure on an economy that is already struggling to achieve inflation targets.\r\n\r\n**Cushion for rate hike**. The TFSA can have a positive impact on the economy by providing a cushion for future changes that may take households by surprise. For instance, the abnormally low interest rate has allowed a large number of people to take mortgages. If the interest rates recover, a TFSA could save home-owners who are facing unexpected increase in the payments for their home.\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [The Globe and Mail, *TFSA move targets savvy investors*, 2009](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/tfsa-move-targets-savvy-investors/article4215495/)  \r\n[2] [The Globe and Mail, *Taxman may forgive TFSA rule breakers*, 2010](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxman-may-forgive-tfsa-rule-breakers/article1373287/)  \r\n[3] [CBC, *Doubling TFSA limit will only help wealthy, study argues*, 2015](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doubling-tfsa-limit-will-only-help-wealthy-study-argues-1.2967796)",

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n - **Andy Ridge**: director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development.\r\n - **The Alberta Water Council**: acts as an advisory board bringing stakeholders and experts together to oversee the implementation of water management strategies.\r\n - **Allan Adams**: Chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  The Chipewyan First Nation uses the Athabasca river extensively, and is affected by water usage practices by industry.\r\n - **Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)**: the interest group representing the oilsands industry in Canada.\r\n - **Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI)** -- six oilsands companies that have initiated and advanced several improvements to water management practices.  Includes Suncor Energy Inc, ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Shell Canada Ltd., Statoil Canada and Total E+P Canada Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\nIn December 2014, the government of Alberta distributed a draft surface water management framework for the Lower Athabasca River to industry, interest groups and First Nations [1].\r\n\r\nMost of the water used for extraction of petroleum from the Albertan oilsands is taken from the Athabasca River [2].  In 2011, oilsands operators used about 170 million cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to the amount of water used by 1.7 million Canadians [2].  This demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2020 [1].\r\n\r\nSurface water that is taken for oilsands extraction cannot be returned because of the toxins in the waste water.  Water can be recycled within the extraction process to an extent, but ultimately, water used in extraction ends up as waste water which has to be stored in tailings ponds or injected deep underground [2].\r\n\r\nIn Alberta's north, water is abundant and demand is still \"relatively low\". But in the southern portion of the province, demand is straining the existing allocation regime and the ecology.   The southern basin is now closed to granting new surface water licenses [3].\r\nAverage discharge from lower Athabasca River's mouth into Lake Athabasca during low-flow periods was 30% less in 1996-2006 than it was in 1966-1976 [2].  Flow downstream of Fort McMurray is predicted to decrease by 30 per cent by 2050, due to the combined impacts of climate change and industrial water withdrawals [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nWater withdrawals during winter low-flow periods risk reducing the availability of fish habitat [1]. Reduction of water flow can destroy the conditions needed for viability of and developing embryos of aquatic species in the river [1]. According to one scientist (David Schindler) even a couple inches in water levels can be critical [1].\r\n\r\nThe Athabasca River is used extensively by about 1000 people from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.  According to Chief Allan Adam [1]: \"When we hit low water levels, a lot of our people won't even be able to get into their traditional territory.\".\r\n\r\nAbout three-quarters of the Chipewyan people use the river several times a week [1].\r\nAdam's band has filed for a judicial review of a land-use plan for the area that includes the proposed water-use framework [1].\r\n\r\nIn addition to affecting water levels, there is evidence that, industrial activity is introducing harmful chemicals into the Athabasca River.\r\nIndependent research suggests concentrations of dissolved polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) are higher downstream of oilsands development, in comparison to upstream, in tributaries to the Athabasca [2]. \r\nThis trend is more pronounced in the summer than in the winter [2].\r\nIndependent research has also found that sediment of lakes in the oilsands region (including one lake approximately 90 kilometres from the major development area) contain between 2.5 and 23 times higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than they did 50 years ago, before the industrial development of the oilsands began [2].\r\n\r\nThe draft water management framework recently released by the government of Alberta would regulate how much water can be removed at different times of the year [1].\r\nIts measures are expected to be implemented by fall 2015 [1].\r\nAt all times, total withdrawals would be a \"small fraction\" of the river's flow and would nearly stop when the Athabasca was flowing at its lowest rate [1].\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no research to suggest that the specific levels of withdrawals prescribed by the new water framework are compatible with the river ecosystem [1].\r\nThe framework is being heavily criticized as lacking a scientific foundation [1].\r\nThe framework does not include studies of the impacts to fish, insects, and other organisms, nor effects on water quality [1].\r\n\r\nAndy Ridge, director of water policy for Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, acknowledges that empirical data is scarce in the drafted framework [1].\r\nInstead, the framework relies on computer modeling to supplement the lack of empirical data [1].\r\nThis corroborates the 2011 findings of Environment Canada and a team of independent experts, who concluded that the current water monitoring system for the Athabasca region \"did not deliver data of sufficient quantity or quality to detect or quantify the effects of oilsands development.\" [2].\r\n\r\nThe existing water management policies do require industrial operators to preferentially use brackish or saline groundwater, only turning to fresh groundwater when other sources do not suffice, and lastly to use fresh surface water [3].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Economic impacts ##\r\n**Realistic and enforceable regulations.** Water usage regulations, as with any regulations, should be consistent with economic and technological constraints.  All other things being equal, more restrictive regulations lead to higher costs in petroleum extraction.  On the other hand, regulations can help create the impetus for technological innovation, which may lead to more efficient and cost-effective approaches in the long-run.\r\n\r\n## Environmental impacts.##\r\n**Ecological damage.** The use of water from the Athabasca river by oilsands operators may cause serious ecological damage.  The lack of scientific research on these effects means that the trade off between economic gains and ecological damages are unknown.  This condition of uncertainty it is likely to lead to greater ecological damages, since they are going unmonitored. \r\n\r\n## Social ##\r\n**Disturbance to local people.** The Athabasca river is a source of livelihood for the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n## Health ##\r\n**Concerns for the health of local people.** The observation of hydrocarbons raises serious concerns about the health effects for people relying on the Athabasca River, including the Athabasca Chipewyan people.\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n- In CAPP\u2019s 2013 Crude Oil Forecast, oil sands production is projected to rise to 5.2 million bpd in 2030 from 1.8 million bpd in 2012.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CTV News, *Alberta's plan for Athabasca River 'pathetic,' not science-based: critics*](http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/alberta-s-plan-for-athabasca-river-pathetic-not-science-based-critics-1.1735778)  \r\n[2] [Pembina Institute, *Water Impacts*, 2013](http://www.pembina.org/oil-sands/os101/water#footnote3_iuh07fc)  \r\n[3] [Alberta Oil, *Alberta desperately needs a water-management plan*, 2013](http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/07/alberta-and-the-life-aquatic/)",

    "text": "# Actors #\r\n\r\n - **Prime minister of Canada**, Stephen Harper -- is in favor of further involvement in fighting ISIS, and expanding current operations to Syria [1].\r\n - **Leader of the Official Opposition**, Thomas Mulcair -- believes that we should preferentially spend resources on humanitarian relief, to feed, clothe, and accept refugees, rather than attack ISIS [8].\r\n - **President of the United States**, Barack Obama -- is leading the fight against ISIS, backed by several Western and Arab allies, including Canada.\r\n - **President of Syria**, Bashar Al-Assad -- tacitly supports western involvement by allowing the US to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria for six months without confrontation [8].\r\n - **ISIS**, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (also ISIL, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and IS, Islamic State) -- a violent splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to take over Syria and Iraq to create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Relations ##\r\nISIS is universally seen as the most violent and menacing group in the conflict in Syria, and there is a general sense that ISIS must be resisted by countries who have the means.  If Canada were to choose not to engage, it would likely be construed as a neglect of moral duty and a failure to follow through on Canada's commitments to its allies.\r\n\r\n## Impacts in Syria ##\r\nWhile the expansion of ISIS surely leads to enormous atrocity, there is no clear path to stability in these areas.  If ISIS is significantly degraded, it is reasonable to expect that the total amount of violence against civilians would be reduced.  However, the other groups in the region, who vie for power, are almost equally brutal, so attacking ISIS in Syria may not be of significant benefit to Syrians.\r\n\r\n## Readiness ##\r\n**Security.** By engaging ISIS, Canada may become a potential target for acts of terrorism.\r\n\r\n## Economic ##\r\nA recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office, finds that the current defense program cannot be sustained without increasing the military budget from 1.1% of GDP (CAD$ 21.5 B) to 1.6% [9].  It is not clear that Canada's investment in fighting ISIS will have a substantial positive impact, which calls to question whether this spending is justified.\r\n\r\n# Background #\r\n\r\n## ISIS ##\r\n**Origins.** ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, also goes by the names ISIL, the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, and simply IS, Islamic State.  ISIS is a jihadist group that grew in the wake of the Iraq war.  After the US and UK overthrew the oppressive autocrat Saddam Hussein, regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts came to the fore [6].  During the war in Iraq, the US had armed militias to help overthrow Saddam Hussein.  After Saddam Hussein was removed, the militias turned on one another and the US.\r\n\r\nISIS is a splinter group of Al-Qaeda that seeks to create an Islamic state in Iraq.  Instability within Syria has created an opportunity for it take territory there, and now ISIS seeks to take over both Iraq and Syria and create a unified Islamic state based on a strict interpretation of the Quran [3].  ISIS occupies a large territory straddling the border between Iraq and Syria [3].\r\n\r\n**Identity.** ISIS proclaims that it represents Muslims of the world.  In fact, ISIS is shunned by the vast majority of people of all religious affiliations, including Muslims in particular.  Their identification with Islam provides an internal basis for legitimacy, and is used to recruit and radicalize new members.  They use this identification to claim that their enemies have declared war on Islam.\r\n\r\n## Conflict in Syria ##\r\nThe Syrian Government is headed by president Bashar Al-Assad.  Assad is an oppressive autocrat who has repeatedly used the Syrian army to kill dissenters and protesters.  Under Assad's leadership, the government has bombed its own people, and is alleged to have used chemical weapons on them as well.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive reign of Assad has led to the emergence of rebel groups that seek to overthrow and replace the government.  The Free Syrian Army is one such group, consisting of defectors from the Syrian Army.  The National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposing Forces, is only nominally united [10]. The BBC estimates that there are up to 1000 different rebel groups in Syria.  Although they have a common goal to overthrow Assad, their are bitter rivalries between rebel groups [10].  The result is a civil without any clear polarity.\r\n\r\nMany of the opposition forces fighting Assad's regime are similar in their brutality: certain opposition militia have engaged in torture, the use of child soldiers, and mass killings [10].  Fighting amongst rebel groups, and between rebel groups and the Syrian government, has caused Syria to descend into chaotic, ungoverned war zone.\r\n\r\nThis context of instability provides an opportunity to ISIS, to seize territory in Syria and challenge the Syrian government and maligned rebels.  The atrocities commited by ISIS are considered to be the worst, but by some accounts Assad's regime arguably surpasses even ISIS itself [10].  The civil war in Syria has cost tens of thousands of lives [2].\r\n\r\n## Canada's initial involvement in Syria ##\r\n**Decision to enter.** In October 2015, after assent by the house of Commons, the government approved the Canadian forces participation in a coalition effort to fight ISIS.  The coalition is US-led, and includes the UK, France, Australia, and many Arab countries [3].  More than 60 countries have joined the coalition [2].  \r\n\r\n**Operations.** The coalition operates under the following limits [3]:\r\n\r\n - no ground fighting\r\n - use airstrikes to attack ISIS positions and disrupt supply lines\r\n\r\nHowever, Canada's Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, were involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones[3].  Only the US and its Arab allies have been active in Syria, Canada, and the other western members of the Coalition, have been active only in Iraq [3].\r\n\r\nCanada's contribution to the effort consists of 600 soldiers, 6 CF-18s (plus one spare), two Aurora reconnaissance planes, and a Polaris aerial refueller [3].  Since 2 Nov 2014, Canadian forces have flown CF-18s daily in a state of readiness to attack [3; 8].  Within the first two weeks of air operations, Canadian war planes destroyed 2 ISIS targets [1].  \r\n\r\nCanadian forces operate under a strict no-civilian casualty policy, and will not strike a target unless the risk of civilian casualties is zero [8].\r\n\r\n**Cost.** The mission has already costed CAD$ 122 M and it is expected to cost an additional $406 M for the next 12 months. Further extensions or the cost of shutting the mission down would be extra [12].\r\n\r\n**Effects.** As of Nov 02 2014, after three months of airstrikes by coalition forces, ISIS appeared undeterred [3].  ISIS Targets have become more difficult to find because they are increasingly hiding among civilian populations, where they are impossible to target without casualties [3].  ISIS has also increasingly shifted its forces to it's western front in Syria, which is outside of Canada's mandate, and that of the other Western allies (except the US).  Shortly after Canada joined the effort, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on all\r\nanti-ISIS coalition forces, and specifically named Canada [2].\r\n\r\n## Proposed extension of Canada's mandate ##\r\n**Time extension.** Canada's participation in the fight against ISIS would be extended for one year, until March 2016.\r\n\r\n**Geographical extension.** The government proposes to extend Canada's mandate to include airstrikes in Syria, whereas previously operations were confined to Iraq.\r\n\r\n## Prognosis ##\r\nUS officials believe the confrontation with ISIS will be a multi-year compaign [3].  The Canadian government's plan has been criticized internally for a lack of any clear endpoint.  It is not clear what it means to \"degrade\" ISIS, nor how to determine when enough degradation has occurred and when to disengage [5].  As the coalition becomes involved in Syria, it might become increasingly committed, since its presence becomes an important contribution to the balance of power, the removal of which could have immediate and visible consequences to human life.  \r\n\r\nEven if ISIS forces are substantially degraded, the people in Syria may not be better off, since power and territory is inevitably transferred from ISIS to the Syrian government and rebel forces [7]. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that, by degrading ISIS forces, the amount of violence inflicted overall in the conflict will be lessened [8].\r\n\r\n\r\n## The case for intervention ##\r\nSome people argue that if the recent intervention in Iraq and Syria had been made earlier, it could have avoided such a decline to chaos that enabled ISIS to flourish [2].  However past interventions, such as in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, point to a consistent pattern of poor outcomes when intervening in similar circumstances [6].  The pattern appears to follow this course [6]: an existing power structure or military agent is identified as being the primary obstacle to freedom and prosperity.  Before intervening, oppression under this agent has given rise to diverse armed opposition groups that seek to remove the existing structure.  External (Western) forces intervene, and the primary power structure is removed, usually with the help of armed opposition groups.  Once the old power structure is overturned, some of the opposition groups try to step into power.  These groups are ill-equipped for the task of governance, which is, of course, completely different from waging of armed warfare.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of civic institutions and needed for a functioning democracy [11].  Even when the external agents attempt to scaffold the development of institutions of governance, they are ineffective [11].  The result is a substitution for a regime that is equally oppressive, or a descent into chronic warfare, as various opposition forces vie for power [6].\r\n\r\nWhile the conflict in Syria matches this schema to a degree, in this case, the proposed intervention is *not* to remove an established power structure, but rather, to degrade an encroaching violent group that aspires to power, ISIS. Despite the fact that Canada and the US have called for Bashar Al-Assad to resign, the Canadian government has no plan to remove Bashar Al-Assad [1], nor to participate in the Syrian conflict in any way other than to assist with strategic attacks on ISIS [1].\r\n\r\nThus, Canadian involvement is strictly to combat, in a highly targeted way, an armed group that is committing terrible crimes against humanity [1].  Given what ISIS is currently doing, and Canada's ability to intervene with airstrikes, it is argued that there is a strong moral imperative to engage.  Furthermore, the Canadian government feels strong pressure from other members of NATO to stay involved and make proportionate contributions to the coalition effort, which is viewed as a humanitarian obligation.\r\n\r\n## Threats of terrorism on Canadian soil ##\r\nThere have been two attacks on Canadian soldiers while in Canada, at least one of which was directly supported by ISIS recruiting [2].  There is concern that fighting ISIS could make Canada a target for terrorist activities.  Shortly after joining the coalition effort to fight ISIS, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks on members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and specifically named Canada.  A number of Canadians are known to be fighting with ISIS, and many are currently trying to go to fight [2].\r\n\r\nHowever, these fears are probably not justified by the actual risks, which, in Canada, are negligible when compared to those directly involved in the conflict.  In 2013, considering all Western nations, there were 12 victims of terror attacks, compared to 22,000 non-Western fatalities, *excluding attacks by the Syrian government on its own people and civilians killed by warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan* [7].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n 1.
