    "text": "# Actors #\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\n- **US Government**:\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\n     - **Canadian Government**:\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\n         - WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\n        \n        # Impacts #\n        ## Environmental Impacts ##\n        **Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\n        \n        The path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length\n        of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\n        \n        **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \n        If the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from\n        Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\n        \n        ## Economic Impacts ##\n        **Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \n        \n        **Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\n        \n        # Social Impacts #\n        **Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\n        \n        **Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\n        \n        **Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\n        \n        # In Perspective #\n         - The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\n         - The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\n         - The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\n         - There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\n         - Alternative projects are being considered:\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "summary": "The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed extension to the existing Keystone Pipeline System, put forward by TransCanada, the corporation that owns the Keystone System. The pipeline would cross the Canada/US border, importing crude oil sourced from the Albertan oil sands, into the United States. The proposal is currently awaiting government approval. The pipeline would be newly constructed, and is similar to existing pipelines in North America.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.",

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\n        The path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length\r\n        of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n        **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n        If the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from\r\n        Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n        ## Economic Impacts ##\r\n        **Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n        **Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n        # Social Impacts #\r\n        **Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n        **Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n        **Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n        # In Perspective #\r\n         - The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n         - The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n         - The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n         - There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n         - Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.

The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.

The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.

Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.

The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "summary": "The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed extension to the existing Keystone Pipeline System, put forward by TransCanada, the corporation that owns the Keystone System. The pipeline would cross the Canada/US border, importing crude oil sourced from the Albertan oil sands, into the United States. The proposal is currently awaiting government approval. The pipeline would be newly constructed, and is similar to existing pipelines in North America.",

    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe term Net Neutrality was originally coined by professor Tim Wu in 2003 (http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF). However, the debate on Net Neutrality was ongoing prior to that. Advocates for Net Neutrality are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network infrastructure to block or otherwise deteriorate access to content, services or websites which are competitors to, or deemed undesirable by, the ISP.\r\nCritics of Net Neutrality claim that network management is needed in order to ensure Quality of Service and to prioritize critical applications such as VoIP telephony or email, over less critical ones, like peer-to-peer networks.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Internet Service Providers**: Companies which connect retail customers to the Internet. Examples include Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Rogers, etc.\r\n - **Transit Service Providers**: Companies, sometimes ISPs or hosting providers, which interconnect ISPs. They are responsible for the backbone of the Internet. When content moves from a hosting provider to an ISP, the Transit Service Providers may collect fees. Examples include Cogent Communications, Hurricane Electric, Level 3 Communications, etc.\r\n - **Established Content Providers**: Include Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. These are large companies, responsible for the majority of content carried over the Internet.\r\n - **Government**: The Government can impose a law on ISPs, requiring Net Neutrality. The main interest of the government is to ensure fair access to content, while promoting economic activity.\r\n - **Alternative Content Providers**: Services like Vimeo, Mega, Popcorn Time and other emerging providers. They may be unable to enter in agreements with ISPs due to lack of funding or legal impediments.\r\n - **Internet Users**: Ordinary people want to maximize their access to content and connection quality, while keeping prices low.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Social Impacts ##\r\n**Content Monopoly**. Alternative content providers are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network to \u201clock-out\u201d competing services or those unable to enter into traffic shaping agreements.\r\n\r\n**Censorship**. Internet users are worry of the impact that control over access to content may have on democracy and freedoms.\r\n\r\n**Quality of Service**. Internet providers claim that some popular content providers cause saturation of the network and degrade the Internet service for all users. Some users are concerned that degraded network performance may impact essential communications services such as access to 911 over VoIP lines.\r\n\r\n**Inequality**. Some content providers claim that the design of Internet protocols already imposes inequality by favouring non time-sensitive applications, such as large file downloads, over real time services like VoIP or multiplayer games. They argue that network management techniques level the playing field for time-sensitive applications.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Internet Service Innovations**. ISPs are concerned that a few content providers utilize most of the available network bandwidth without paying a proportional access fee. Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon.

In order to collect data, authorities must suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the information will assist in the crime's investigation. \r\n\r\nThe bill establishes (in section 162.1) that sharing \"intimate images\" of a person, when the person in the image has not consented to the sharing, is an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.  Although the bill has been described (by Peter MacKay) as intended to protect children and youth from online predators, existing Criminal Code provisions (section 163.1 - Child Pornography) already criminalize the mere posession of such images, with harsher penalty.  Therefore, this bill only extends the provisions against the use of intimate images involving adults [1].\r\n\r\nSection 162.1 also does not establish the need for malicious intent.  This means that in a hypothetical situation where Mr. Smith lends his laptop to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith might be liable for having shared intimate images of him and his wife, even though they are in a deep folder marked \"private\", and he did not think that Mr. Jones would look there [1]. Other possibilities exist, and arise wording in section 162.1 which permits wide interpretation [1].  This also exposes the media, such as photojournalists, to criminal sanction for publishing compromising images of celebrities or politicians [1].\r\n\r\nThe Bar proposed other amendments to encourage a focus on cyberbullying and proportionate sentencing [1].  Further, they warn against excessive reliance on law to handle cyberbullying committed by youth, which may be less effective than education and other preventative measures [1]. \r\n\r\nBill C-13 goes far beyond cyberbullying, and instead describes provisions for the search and seizure of Internet Data, revisiting \"lawful access\" legislation, which has previously been controversial [1].  The Canadian Bar Association recommended splitting the Bill into two bills, one which addresses cyberbullying, and the other to address lawful access legislation.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n- CSEC\r\n- Government of Canada\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Culture ##\r\n- The criminalization of cyberbullying would enable law enforcement to take action against people committing cyberbullying, and might reduce its prevalence.u \r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] Commentary by the Canadian Bar Association ([pdf](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDQQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cba.org%2Fcba%2Fsubmissions%2Fpdf%2F14-33-eng.pdf&ei=Lk3cVJm9DoagNuCTgbAG&usg=AFQjCNHfIQ7iJmSssJ-kyhHJvOqwUoLRGg&sig2=A7dmQIKgYQnp9SzNteMAOw&bvm=bv.85761416,d.eXY))",

In the case of crimes in Canada, preservation would be for 21 days, while for foreign laws, for 90 days.  The CBA recommended reducing these periods to only cover a reasonable amount of time needed to get judicial authorization, and that preservation demands should only be applicable for crimes according to foreign laws which would also be crimes in Canada.

People may be added to the list if\r\n    - the minister has reasonable grounds to suspect that they will threaten transportation security\r\n    - commit a \"terrorism offense\" in Canada, or an act which, if committed in canada would constitute a \"terrorism offense\"\r\nSuch people may be denied travel, and Air carriers can be compelled to assist in ensuring that listed people do are unable to carry out \"terrorism offenses\" or acts that threaten the transportation security.\r\n - a listed person that has been denied transportation has the right request that their names be removed from the list, and to be given reasonable opportunity to represent themselves, as well as appeal to a judge to have their name removed.\r\n - with certain exceptins, the list is to be kept secret.   \r\n - extends the minister of transport's abilities to obtain documents from or inspect any aircraft, aerodome, or other aviation facility or any premises used by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.\r\n - the portion of the bill which has attracted particular controversy is section 83.221 (1):\r\n\r\n    Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes the \r\n    commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n    section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n    reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n    communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for \r\n    a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n - The RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent.[5] \r\n - Bill C-51 contains a section that gives the government the power to order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or website administrators to remove content if a judge deems the material to be \"terrorist propoganda\" [1]\r\n - Bill C-51 targets activity that \"undermines the security of Canada\" by interfering with federal capabilities in relation to the country's economic or \"financial stability\" [6]\r\n - By rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. [6]\r\n - For comparison, existing legislation allows ordering the removal of \"hate propoganda\" and child pornography. [1]\r\n - The department of justice says that this is similar to legislation existing in UK and Australia. [1]\r\n - In June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs. [1][2][3]\r\n - It is unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is.  It may be possible for artistic expression and political dissent to be construed as terrorist propoganda, interfearing with open dialogue and expression.[1] \r\n - CSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere with terrorist plots, by [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n \r\n - The bill prohibits \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" terrorism, although the definition of these terms is not given.\r\n - The Criminal Code's definition of terrorism is very permissive, including not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\n - Allowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time. \r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\n - By lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue surveillance of those expressing political dissent. [1]\r\n - The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to shifting and overreaching prosecution [5].\r\n - It is suggested [6] that demonstrations and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability.  As an example, consider demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\n - Material considered to be \"terrorist propoganda\" could be essentially removed from the Internet normally accessible to Canadians.\r\n - Political and artistic expression, near the fringe, may be self-sensored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propoganda\". [1]\r\n - The uncertainty created by the law may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, because they may believe they will be found guilty for their beliefs. [5] \r\n - Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels specifically, or simply the rebellion against totalitarian regimes in principle, could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\". [6]\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - In the UK in 2010 more than 65,000 pieces of unlawful terrorist related content was removed, 80% of which was jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria[1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order, while the law enables the government to compel hosts in the UK to remove content.[1] \r\n - In Australia ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order.[1]\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked / removed. [1]\r\n - Relative to France, the US, Australia, and Britain, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation is less invasive.[4]\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC.

    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offense\" and \"Terrorist propoganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offenses\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about the bill have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propoganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offense [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a resonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  The bill allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe act introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promation\" of terrorism offenses.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     *Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years.* [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n - In the bill, terrorist propoganda is defined as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propoganda ##\r\n - The bill allows judges to order \"custodians\" of computer systems (such as the operators of websites, or ISPs) to delete material deemed to be terrorist propoganda.  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision.[7]\r\n - Bill C-51 contains a section that gives the government the power to order Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or website administrators to remove content if a judge deems the material to be \"terrorist propoganda\" [1]\r\n - The RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent.[5] \r\n - For comparison, existing legislation allows ordering the removal of \"hate propoganda\" and child pornography. [1]\r\n - The department of justice says that this is similar to legislation existing in UK and Australia. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Powers for CSIS ##\r\n - CSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere with terrorist plots, by [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\n - The bill allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfill their mandates and when it is a matter of national security [7]\r\n - In June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs. [1][2][3]\r\n - Judges can order ISPs to provide identidying information of the sources of terrorist propoganda so that they may be located [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No fly list ##\r\n - The bill establishes a list of individuals, to be maintained by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  People may be added to the list if\r\n    - the minister has reasonable grounds to suspect that they will threaten transportation security\r\n    - commit a \"terrorism offense\" in Canada, or an act which, if committed in canada would constitute a \"terrorism offense\"\r\nSuch people may be denied travel, and Air carriers can be compelled to assist in ensuring that listed people do are unable to carry out \"terrorism offenses\" or acts that threaten the transportation security.\r\n - a listed person that has been denied transportation has the right request that their names be removed from the list, and to be given reasonable opportunity to represent themselves, as well as appeal to a judge to have their name removed.\r\n - with certain exceptins, the list is to be kept secret.   \r\n\r\n - extends the minister of transport's abilities to obtain documents from or inspect any aircraft, aerodome, or other aviation facility or any premises used by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\n - Allowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time. \r\n - By rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\n - By lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue surveillance of those expressing political dissent. [1]\r\n - The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to shifting and overreaching prosecution [5].\r\n - It is suggested [6] that demonstrations and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability.  As an example, consider demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\n - Material considered to be \"terrorist propoganda\" could be essentially removed from the Internet normally accessible to Canadians.\r\n - Political and artistic expression, near the fringe, may be self-sensored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propoganda\". [1]\r\n - The uncertainty created by the law may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, because they may believe they will be found guilty for their beliefs.

From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorrist propoganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a resonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  The bill allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promation\" of terrorism offenses.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propoganda ##\r\nThe bill also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propoganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision.[7]\r\nCurrently, the RCMP runs a counter-violent extremism (CVE) program, which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5], and it the criminalization of terrorist propoganda might interfere with the availability of natural intelligence through social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP who can act on it.  The bill would give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offenses, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nThe bill allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfill their mandates and when it is a matter of national security [7].  Judges can order ISPs to provide identidying information of the sources of terrorist propoganda so that they may be located [4].  Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from traveling, or subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe bill lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from traveling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\nAllowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time, and will likely lead to more effective protection against terrorist activities [4].\r\n\r\nBy rendering the promotion / advocacy of terrorist propoganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence will be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\nBy lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-sensorship or undue surveillance of those expressing political dissent [1].  The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to \"prosecutory overreach\" [5].\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested [6] that protests and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability.  As an example, consider demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\nMaterial considered to be \"terrorist propoganda\" could be partially removed from the Internet normally accessible to Canadians.\r\nPolitical and artistic expression, \"near the fringe\", may be self-censored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propaganda\". [1]\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty created by the law may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, for example, as part of the CVE program, because those people might be more fearful of law enforcement [5]. \r\n\r\nThe wide interpretation of \"terrorism advocacy\" could hamper the freedom of expression.  Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\" [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - Existing legislation allows a judge to order the removal of \"hate propoganda\" and child pornography [1]\r\n - In the UK in 2010 more than 65,000 pieces of unlawful terrorist related content was removed, 80% of which was jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria [1]\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked / removed.

    "title": "Keystone XL Pipeline Extension",
    "text": "#Background#\r\nThe Keystone XL pipeline project is a contentious political issue, owing to probable environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, the pipeline might present a risk of contaminating groundwater and disturbing sensitive ecosystems, but it might also be a better alternative than ground transport by train or truck. Economically, the pipeline might produce jobs temporarily during its construction, and permanently in additional refinement activities in the US. It would also lead to a redistribution of crude supply, emphasizing export and raising the price of oil in the Midwestern US. Socially, the construction of the pipeline would disturb landowners currently in its path, and would disturb heritage sites of cultural significance.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **TransCanada**: Corporation that owns the existing Keysone Pipeline System, and which has put forward the proposal to state and federal authorities for the Keystone XL extension.\r\n - **ConocoPhillips**: Corporation that was part-owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, bought out by TransCanada.\r\n - **Cardno Entrix**: Environmental Assessment Consultancy, contracted by TransCanada to produce an environmental assessment of the Keystone XL proposal.\r\n- **US Government**:\r\n        - **President Obama**: Can approve or reject the application for a Presidential Permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project. \r\n         - **Environmental Protection Agency**: Oversees the environmental assessment of the project, and approves or rejects the application for an environmental permit, legally needed to proceed with the construction project.\r\n         - **US State Governments**: Each US state through which the proposed pipeline would pass can approve or reject the construction activities within its borders.\r\n     - **Canadian Government**:\r\n             - **National Energy Board of Canada** (NEB): Responsible for approving or rejecting the construction activities within Canada.\r\n- WorleyParsons: Corporation acting as the general contractor for the pipeline construction.\r\n        \r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Environmental Impacts ##\r\n**Hazards relating to oil spills**. The originally proposed route traversed the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer.  The Sand Hills region is a sensitive wetland ecosystem in Nebraska.  The Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports a US$20 billion worth of agricultural activity.\r\n        \r\nThe path of the pipeline has been revised by TransCanada to avoid the Sand Hills region, and reduce the length of piping running over the Ogallala aquifer.  The actual risks of a spill in the region of the aquifer are unclear, and the severity of impact is debated.  The pipeline, with a normal depth of 4 feet would be separated from the aquifer by a layer of fine clay, which might drastically reduce the actual effects on drinking water.  Thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, so the severity of risk could be evaluated empirically.  The pipeline will be newly constructed, which should be considered when comparing to existing pipelines which do not benefit from technological advances or were converted from natural gas pipelines.\r\n        \r\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**.  The Keystone XL pipeline would carry crude oil to refineries for conversion into fuels, among other products.  The activities of extracting, refining, and burning petroleum-derived fuels is a major contributor to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere and climate change.  By providing access to US and global markets, the Keystone XL pipeline would facilitate further extraction in the oilsands of Alberta.  \r\n\r\nIf the Keystone XL pipeline is not built, crude from the Albertan tarsands might be refined and exported from Canada, based on alternative Canadian pipeline  construction projects which would bring the crude to tidewater.  Additionally, ground transport of crude, by train and tanker, might be used instead, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions and poses its own safety hazards.\r\n        \r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Employment**.  Construction of the pipeline would provide temporary employment for about 2 years.  Estimates of the amount of employment vary widely.  A report by Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm that was hired by TransCanada, estimates construction would employ 20,000 US workers and spend US$7 billion.  A study conducted by Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute estimated construction would employ 2500 to 4650 US workers.  The US State Department estimated 5000 to 6000 temporary construction jobs.  It's Supplemenntal Environmental Impact Statement estimated 3900 US workers directly employed and 42000 US workers indirectly employed by construction activities. \r\n        \r\n**Risk of impact due to spills**.  The original route proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline passed over the Ogallala aquifer.  The aquifer supports about US$20 billion in agricultural activity.  If a spill contaminated the water, it could have serious economic impact.  The amended proposal has reduced the length of piping that crosses the aquifer.  The 2010 Enbridge oil spill along the Kalamazoo river in Michigan showed that spills can result in significant economic costs beyond environmental ones.\r\n        \r\n# Social Impacts #\r\n**Displacement of people**.  Land owners in the path of the pipeline would be displaced.  Landowners have already complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and some have faced lawsuits.  As of October 17, 2011 Transcanada had 34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and 22 in South Dakota.\r\n        \r\n**Damage to public goods (excluding the environment)**.  Various sacred sites, and prehistoric or historic archeological sites, and sites with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups might be disturbed, removed or demolished.  TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population.\r\n        \r\n**Safety**.  Ground transport by tanker truck and rail is less safe.  As an example, the derailment of a train transporting crude oil at Lac-M\u00e9gantic in 2013 kiled 50 people.  Increased production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.  Alberta is expected to running up against a pipeline capacity limit around 2016.\r\n        \r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- The Alberta oil sands account for a quantity of GHG emissions equal to \r\n             - the coal-fired power plants in the State of Wisconsin \r\n             - 2.5% of total GHG emissions from the coal-fired power plants of the US\r\n             - 0.1% of global GHG emissions from all sources\r\n- The Enbridge \"Alberta Clipper\" expansion has continued during late 2013, adding approximately the same cross-border capacity.\r\n- The Keystone XL expansion is Phase 4 in the Keystone Pipeline system.\r\n             - it corresponds to between 1897 km, later revised to 1408 km of piping or 28% revised to 23% of the Keystone system by length.\r\n             - it will account for about 40% of the Keystone system's capacity if built.\r\n- There are currently about 320,000 km of similar oil pipelines in the US.\r\n- Alternative projects are being considered:\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast for shipping to markets in Europe and Asia\r\n                 - An all-Canadian pipeline (\"Energy East\") that would extend to Saint John, New Brunswick for export, while also supplying Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John refineries.",

    "title": "Net Neutrality",
    "text": "\r\n#Background#\r\nThe term Net Neutrality was originally coined by professor Tim Wu in 2003 (http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF). However, the debate on Net Neutrality was ongoing prior to that. Advocates for Net Neutrality are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network infrastructure to block or otherwise deteriorate access to content, services or websites which are competitors to, or deemed undesirable by, the ISP.\r\nCritics of Net Neutrality claim that network management is needed in order to ensure Quality of Service and to prioritize critical applications such as VoIP telephony or email, over less critical ones, like peer-to-peer networks.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n - **Internet Service Providers**: Companies which connect retail customers to the Internet. Examples include Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Rogers, etc.\r\n - **Transit Service Providers**: Companies, sometimes ISPs or hosting providers, which interconnect ISPs. They are responsible for the backbone of the Internet. When content moves from a hosting provider to an ISP, the Transit Service Providers may collect fees. Examples include Cogent Communications, Hurricane Electric, Level 3 Communications, etc.\r\n - **Established Content Providers**: Include Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. These are large companies, responsible for the majority of content carried over the Internet.\r\n - **Government**: The Government can impose a law on ISPs, requiring Net Neutrality. The main interest of the government is to ensure fair access to content, while promoting economic activity.\r\n - **Alternative Content Providers**: Services like Vimeo, Mega, Popcorn Time and other emerging providers. They may be unable to enter in agreements with ISPs due to lack of funding or legal impediments.\r\n - **Internet Users**: Ordinary people want to maximize their access to content and connection quality, while keeping prices low.\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Social Impacts ##\r\n**Content Monopoly**. Alternative content providers are concerned that ISPs may use their control over the network to \u201clock-out\u201d competing services or those unable to enter into traffic shaping agreements.\r\n\r\n**Censorship**. Internet users are worry of the impact that control over access to content may have on democracy and freedoms.\r\n\r\n**Quality of Service**. Internet providers claim that some popular content providers cause saturation of the network and degrade the Internet service for all users. Some users are concerned that degraded network performance may impact essential communications services such as access to 911 over VoIP lines.\r\n\r\n**Inequality**. Some content providers claim that the design of Internet protocols already imposes inequality by favouring non time-sensitive applications, such as large file downloads, over real time services like VoIP or multiplayer games. They argue that network management techniques level the playing field for time-sensitive applications.\r\n\r\n## Economic Impacts ##\r\n**Internet Service Innovations**. ISPs are concerned that a few content providers utilize most of the available network bandwidth without paying a proportional access fee. Thus, they claim that further innovations in Internet services would be hindered unless tiered Internet access is introduced.\r\n\r\n**\u201cDouble dipping\u201d**. Some content providers are worried that without Net Neutrality ISPs may charge twice for transmitting the same content: once as Transit Service Providers when content leaves the source, and a second time as ISPs when content reaches the subscriber.\r\n\r\n**Tiered service**. Consumers are concerned that, without Net Neutrality, ISPs may introduce tiered service requiring them to pay extra for access to the content they are already subscribing to.\r\n\r\n**Interference with free market**. Critics of Net Neutrality claim that government intervention impacts the free market\u2019s ability to reach price equilibrium based on supply and demand at the various levels of service quality.\r\n\r\n# In Perspective #\r\n- Some providers in the developing world offer what is known as \u201cFree Zones\u201d, meaning that content providers have entered in an agreement with the ISP to cover fees associated with accessing the content over the ISP\u2019s network (Lily Hay Newman (21 Jan 2014). \"Net Neutrality Is Already in Trouble in the Developing World\". Slate. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014).\r\n\r\n- In December 2009, a major US ISP (Comcast) admitted to applying traffic shaping practices against BitTorrent traffic on its network and agreed to pay up to $16 Million USD as a settlement (Duncan, Geoff (23 December 2009). \"Comcast to Pay $16 Million for Blocking P2P Applications\". Digital Trends. Retrieved 23 December 2009.)\r\n\r\n- The French ISP Orange has reached an agreement with Google, which stipulates that Google reimburses Orange for YouTube traffic (which amounts to about 50% of all traffic on the Orange network) (Robertson, Adi (2013-01-19). \"French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network\". The Verge. Retrieved 14 January 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Some services, like Xbox gaming and IPTV, already receive preferential treatment over the network of US ISP Comcast. (Brendan Greeley (21 Jun 2012). \"Comcast 'Invents' Its Own Private Internet\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 18 Nov 2014.)\r\n\r\n- Netflix, a major US video content provider, has established peering agreements with US ISPs Comcast and Verizon. It is debatable whether peering agreements are a violation of Net Neutrality, however they were reached in response to deteriorated performance of access to Netflix content over the ISPs\u2019 networks.

ISPs may not apply traffic shaping or other network management techniques based on the type of content or the parties that are exchanging it. Proponents of Net Neutrality claim that in this respect it is similar to a telephone call: a phone company must treat all calls equally, regardless of what is being said or by whom.\r\nThere is a debate, particularly in the United States, whether the government should enact the Net Neutrality principle as a law.",

    "title": "Bill C-13, Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act",
    "text": "# Background #\r\nA central nominal goal of Bill C-13 is to criminalize cyberbullying [1], which the Canadian Bar Association identifies as an 'Obvious legislative \"gap\"' [1]. In order to collect data, authorities must suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the information will assist in the crime's investigation. \r\n\r\nThe bill establishes (in section 162.1) that sharing \"intimate images\" of a person, when the person in the image has not consented to the sharing, is an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.  Although the bill has been described (by Peter MacKay) as intended to protect children and youth from online predators, existing Criminal Code provisions (section 163.1 - Child Pornography) already criminalize the mere posession of such images, with harsher penalty.  Therefore, this bill only extends the provisions against the use of intimate images involving adults [1].\r\n\r\nSection 162.1 also does not establish the need for malicious intent.  This means that in a hypothetical situation where Mr. Smith lends his laptop to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith might be liable for having shared intimate images of him and his wife, even though they are in a deep folder marked \"private\", and he did not think that Mr. Jones would look there [1]. Other possibilities exist, and arise wording in section 162.1 which permits wide interpretation [1].  This also exposes the media, such as photojournalists, to criminal sanction for publishing compromising images of celebrities or politicians [1].\r\n\r\nThe Bar proposed other amendments to encourage a focus on cyberbullying and proportionate sentencing [1].  Further, they warn against excessive reliance on law to handle cyberbullying committed by youth, which may be less effective than education and other preventative measures [1]. \r\n\r\nBill C-13 goes far beyond cyberbullying, and instead describes provisions for the search and seizure of Internet Data, revisiting \"lawful access\" legislation, which has previously been controversial [1].  The Canadian Bar Association recommended splitting the Bill into two bills, one which addresses cyberbullying, and the other to address lawful access legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Association of the Bar acknowledges the concern of the Canadian Government, but has recommended that enhancements to state power which infringe on privacy should be coupled with effective oversight mechanisms. [1]\r\n\r\nSection 487.012 provides the power for police officers to make \"preservation demands\", without any judicial authorization, which requires a person to preserve (i.e. not delete) data, if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a crime has or will be committed, and that the data will assist in the investigation, or that a crime under any Foreign law has or will be committed.  In the case of crimes in Canada, preservation would be for 21 days, while for foreign laws, for 90 days.  The CBA recommended reducing these periods to only cover a reasonable amount of time needed to get judicial authorization, and that preservation demands should only be applicable for crimes according to foreign laws which would also be crimes in Canada.  The Act does not require written records to be kept. (CBA recommends this be required.)\r\n\r\nSubsection 5 of 487.012 gives officers the ability to impose unlimited conditions on preservation demands.  According to CBA, such conditions could prevent a party from exercising lawful rights, and such restrictions should only be imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe bill empowers judges to issue production orders for tracking data (such as GPS data), information identifying financial account holders, and the use of tracking devices, but with a lower threshold than previously existed -- \r\nonly requiring that the judge be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that on offense has or will be committed.\r\n\r\nSection 492.2 updates laws which enabled officers to obtain telephone metadata to allow law enforcement to install \"transmission data recorders\" to capture metadata related to any kind of telecommunications.  Because of the richness of digital telecommunications, this could identify far more detailed biographical information about the individual, and so is a materially more severe invasion of privacy.  Warrants to use a transmission data recorder also only need to be justified by reasonable grounds to *suspect* (as opposed to believe) that an offense has or will be committed.  Information that could be captured would include\r\n\r\n - the IP address of the originating computer and server (i.e. website) being communicated with\r\n - the computer program being used\r\n - the protocol being used (identifying whether the person is viewing a website, using videoconferencing, etc)\r\n - whether the transmission was completed\r\n\r\nThis would enable, for example, to tell whether a person had been communicating on a regular basis with a particular health professional, or accessing a particular online service.\r\n\r\n# Actors #\r\n- CSEC\r\n- Government of Canada\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Culture ##\r\n- The criminalization of cyberbullying would enable law enforcement to take action against people committing cyberbullying, and might reduce its prevalence.u \r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] Commentary by the Canadian Bar Association ([pdf](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDQQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cba.org%2Fcba%2Fsubmissions%2Fpdf%2F14-33-eng.pdf&ei=Lk3cVJm9DoagNuCTgbAG&usg=AFQjCNHfIQ7iJmSssJ-kyhHJvOqwUoLRGg&sig2=A7dmQIKgYQnp9SzNteMAOw&bvm=bv.85761416,d.eXY))",

    "title": "Bill C-51 Anti-terrorism Act, 2015",
    "text": "# Background #\r\n\r\n## \"Terrorism offence\" and \"Terrorist propaganda\" ##\r\nIt is important to understand the meaning of \"terrorism offences\", and other related ideas.  Many concerns about bill C-51 have been raised due to the notion of terrorism being too broad. The definition of \"terrorism\" in the Criminal Code includes not only acts of violence, but also any act committed for a political purpose that is intended to compel any government to do or refrain from doing something [5].\r\n\r\nTerrorist propaganda, in turn, is defined in Bill C-51 as \"advocating\" or \"promoting\" a terrorism offence [7].  From the bill:\r\n\r\n     \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d means any writing, sign, visible \r\n     representation or audio recording that advocates or promotes the \r\n     commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence \r\n     under subsection 83.221(1) \u2014 or counsels the commission of a \r\n     terrorism offence. [7] \r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, unclear how expansive \"terrorist propaganda\" is [1].  Bill C-51 also introduces the notion of actions that \"undermin[e] the security of Canada or its economic or financial stability\", which might be interpreted broadly [6][7].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lower threshold for evidence ##\r\nIn various other places, with respect to legislature relating to terrorist activities, the standard of evidence has been reduced from a reasonable belief that acts will be committed, to a reasonable belief that acts *may* be committed [7].  Bill C-51 allows for the detainment, without warrant, of a person who \"may\" commit a terrorist act, for a limited period of time if it is not practical to obtain a warrant first.  This period has been extended from three to seven days [].  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Criminalization of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 introduces new laws prohibiting the \"advocacy\" or \"promotion\" of terrorism offences.  Section 83.221(1) appears to have drawn the most concern from critics:\r\n\r\n     Every person who, by communicating statements, knowingly advocates or promotes \r\n     the commission of terrorism offences in general \u2014 other than an offence under this \r\n     section \u2014 while knowing that any of those offences will be committed or being \r\n     reckless as to whether any of those offences may be committed, as a result of such \r\n     communication, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment \r\n     for a term of not more than five years. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removal of terrorist propaganda ##\r\nBill C-51 also enables judges to order the deletion material deemed to be terrorist propaganda from computer systems [1][7].  The originator of the material can appear before the judge to represent themselves and appeal the decision [7].\r\nCurrently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) runs a program entitled Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) which attempts to connect with people who hold radical views and prevent them from becoming violent [5]. However, the criminalization of terrorist propaganda might interfere with the availability of intelligence that would occur naturally on social media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New powers for CSIS ##\r\nCSIS currently only has the ability to investigate, and must pass information to the RCMP, who can then act on it.  Bill C-51 will give CSIS the power to actively interfere in order to prevent terrorism offences, by taking certain actions, including [4]:\r\n    - cancelling travel reservations made by suspected extremists,\r\n    - blocking shipments to Canada of material that could be used in a terrorist attack,\r\n    - rendering shipments of suspected terrorist-related material unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy ##\r\nBill c-51 allows for the sharing of information between government institutions, when such sharing is needed for said institutions to fulfil their mandates, and when it is a matter of national security [7].  Judges can order Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide identifying information of the sources of terrorist propaganda so that they may be located [4].  Recall that in June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is required for law enforcement to obtain identifying information about Canadians from ISPs [1][2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## No-fly list ##\r\nThe so-called \"no-fly list\" is a secret list of individuals that may be prevented from travelling, or who are subject to screening, by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  Airline carriers are legally required to cooperate in this respect.\r\n\r\nBill C-51 lowers the threshold for evidence needed to put people onto the \"no-fly list\" and establishes the appeal process for individuals who have been prevented from travelling [7][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Impacts #\r\n## Readiness #\r\nAllowing CSIS to use the information it has to take action to prevent terrorist plots will reduce the response time, and will likely lead to more effective protection against terrorist activities [4].\r\n\r\nBy rendering the promotion/advocacy of terrorist propaganda illegal, a valuable source of intelligence could be suppressed, driving actual terrorist plots underground. This could lead to less effective protection against terrorist activities [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Democracy ##\r\nBy lowering the standard of evidence, the new laws may lead to self-censorship or undue and unnecessary surveillance of those expressing political dissent [1].  The vague definitions of \"advocating\" and \"promoting\" terrorism may lead to \"persecutory overreach\" [5].\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that protests and civil disobedience could be construed as undermining the security of Canada, or its economic or financial stability [6].  As an example, consider a demonstration by environmentalists peacefully obstructing work on a new pipeline installation [6]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Culture ##\r\nMaterial considered to be \"terrorist propaganda\" could be partially removed from the Internet information normally accessible to Canadians.\r\nPolitical and artistic expression \"near the fringe\" may be self-censored, since it is not clear what constitutes \"terrorist propaganda\" [1].\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty created by Bill C-51 may make it more difficult for law enforcement to engage with people who are suspected to be susceptible to radicalization, for example, as part of the CVE program, because those people might be more fearful of law enforcement [5]. \r\n\r\nThe wide interpretation of \"terrorism advocacy\" could hamper the freedom of expression.  Consider cases in other countries, in which revolutionary and violent struggle exists with a regime widely recognized to be oppressive: due to the broad definition of \"terrorism\" in the criminal code, vocalizing support for rebels could be considered the advocacy of \"terrorism\" [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# In perspective #\r\n - Existing legislation allows a judge to order the removal of \"hate propaganda\" and child pornography [1].\r\n - In the UK, in 2010, more than 65 000 pieces of unlawful terrorism-related content was removed, 80% of which was from jihadist groups from Iraq and Syria [1].\r\n - The UK has no requirement for public disclosure about how often and what content is blocked and/or removed. [1]\r\n - In the UK, the government reached an agreement with ISPs to voluntarily block content from outside the UK, at the request of the UK counterterrorism unit, without court order [1]. \r\n - In Australia, ISPs and websites can be compelled to remove content, and action can be taken against them if they refuse.  For content outside the country, the ASIO or federal police can order ISPs or websites to block the content, without court order [1].\r\n - Relative to France, the USA, Australia, and the UK, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation is \"less invasive\" [4].\r\n\r\n# References #\r\n[1] [CBC.

    "summary": "The anti-terrorism act introduces several measures aimed at countering terrorism.  It expands CSIS's powers, permitting CSIS not only to investigate, but to actively disrupt terrorist activities.  Bill C-51 allows for the sharing of personally identifying information about Canadians, between government institutions, when it is a matter of national security.  Bill C-51 reduces the standard of evidence for taking enforcement action against terrorist offences that are believed will occur.  It renders the \"promotion\" or \"advocacy\" of terrorist offences illegal.",
